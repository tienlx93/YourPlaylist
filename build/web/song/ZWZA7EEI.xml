    <Lyrics>I don't know how I survived&lt;br&gt; In this cold and empty world for all this time&lt;br&gt; I only know that I'm alive&lt;br&gt; Because you love me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When I recall what I've been through&lt;br&gt; There's some things&lt;br&gt; That I wish I didn't do&lt;br&gt; Now I do the things I do&lt;br&gt; Because you love me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And now that you're in my life&lt;br&gt; I'm so glad I'm alive&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you showed me the way&lt;br&gt; And I know now how good it can be&lt;br&gt; Because you love me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And now that you're in my life&lt;br&gt; Oh, I'm so glad I'm alive&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you showed me the way&lt;br&gt; And I know now how good it can be&lt;br&gt; Because you love me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I believe in things unseen&lt;br&gt; I believe in the message of a dream&lt;br&gt; And I believe in what you are&lt;br&gt; Because you love me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With all my heart and all my soul&lt;br&gt; I'm loving you and I never will let go&lt;br&gt; And every day I'll let it show&lt;br&gt; Because you love me&lt;br&gt; Because you love me&lt;br&gt; Because you love me</Lyrics>

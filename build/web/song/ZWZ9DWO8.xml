    <Lyrics>If I Ain't Got You:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Some people live for the fortune&lt;br&gt; Some people live just for the fame&lt;br&gt; Some people live for the power, yeah&lt;br&gt; Some people live just to play the game&lt;br&gt; Some people think that the physical things&lt;br&gt; Define what's within&lt;br&gt; And I've been there before&lt;br&gt; But that life's a bore&lt;br&gt; So full of the superficial&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chor us:]&lt;br&gt; Some people want it all&lt;br&gt; But I don't want nothing at all&lt;br&gt; If it ain't you baby&lt;br&gt; If I ain't got you baby&lt;br&gt; Some people want diamond rings&lt;br&gt; Some just want everything&lt;br&gt; But everything means nothing&lt;br&gt; If I ain't got you, Yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Some people search for a fountain&lt;br&gt; That promises forever young&lt;br&gt; Some people need three dozen roses&lt;br&gt; And that's the only way to prove you love them&lt;br&gt; Hand me the world on a silver platter&lt;br&gt; And what good would it be&lt;br&gt; With no one to share&lt;br&gt; With no one who truly cares for me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; Som e people want it all&lt;br&gt; But I don't want nothing at all&lt;br&gt; If it ain't you baby&lt;br&gt; If I ain't got you baby&lt;br&gt; Some people want diamond rings&lt;br&gt; Some just want everything&lt;br&gt; But everything means nothing&lt;br&gt; If I ain't got you, you, you&lt;br&gt; Some people want it all&lt;br&gt; But I don't want nothing at all&lt;br&gt; If it ain't you baby&lt;br&gt; If I ain't got you baby&lt;br&gt; Some people want diamond rings&lt;br&gt; Some just want everything&lt;br&gt; But everything means nothing&lt;br&gt; If I ain't got you, yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Outro:]&lt;br&gt; If I ain't got you with me baby&lt;br&gt; So nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing&lt;br&gt; If I ain't got you with me baby</Lyrics>

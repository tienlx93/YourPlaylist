    <Lyrics>&quot;Somebody's Me&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You, do you remember me?&lt;br&gt; Like I remember you?&lt;br&gt; Do you spend your life&lt;br&gt; Going back in your mind to that time?&lt;br&gt; Because I, I walk the streets alone&lt;br&gt; I hate being on my own&lt;br&gt; And everyone can see that I really fell&lt;br&gt; And I'm going through hell&lt;br&gt; Thinking about you with somebody else&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [CHORUS]&lt;br&gt; Somebody wants you&lt;br&gt; Somebody needs you&lt;br&gt; Somebody dreams about you every single night&lt;br&gt; Somebody can't breath without you, it's lonely&lt;br&gt; Somebody hopes that one day you will see&lt;br&gt; That Somebody's Me [2x]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; How, How could we go wrong&lt;br&gt; It was so good and now it's gone&lt;br&gt; And I pray at night that our paths soon will cross&lt;br&gt; And what we had isn't lost&lt;br&gt; Cause you're always right here in my thoughts&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Somebody wants you&lt;br&gt; Somebody needs you&lt;br&gt; Somebody dreams about you every single night&lt;br&gt; Somebody can't breath without you, it's lonely&lt;br&gt; Somebody hopes that one day you will see&lt;br&gt; That Somebody's Me [2x]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You'll always be in my life&lt;br&gt; Even if I'm not in your life&lt;br&gt; Because you're in my memory&lt;br&gt; You, when you remember me&lt;br&gt; And before you set me free&lt;br&gt; Oh listen please&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Somebody wants you&lt;br&gt; Somebody needs you&lt;br&gt; Somebody dreams about you every single night&lt;br&gt; Somebody can't breath without you, it's lonely&lt;br&gt; Somebody hopes that one day you will see&lt;br&gt; That Somebody's Me [5x]</Lyrics>

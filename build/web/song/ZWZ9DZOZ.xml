    <Lyrics>You never looked more beautiful&lt;br&gt; Than you look tonight&lt;br&gt; In your eyes I see all I can be &lt;br&gt; And how you changed my life&lt;br&gt; You held on when I let go &lt;br&gt; Now all I want is to let you know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; C H O R U S&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Your love is like a river&lt;br&gt; It runs through my heart and soul&lt;br&gt; It's deep when I'm thristy and warm when I'm cold&lt;br&gt; And when I feel forgotten I come runnin' to your shore&lt;br&gt; And find peace of mind time after time&lt;br&gt; You give me everything and more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When tomorrow comes I can face the morning&lt;br&gt; In a different light&lt;br&gt; You can change your mind a thousand times&lt;br&gt; Nothing will ever change mine 'cause&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; C H O R U S &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The sun will rise and the light will shine&lt;br&gt; Everything will be alright&lt;br&gt; Oh, yes it will 'cause&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; C H O R U S&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Your love is like a river&lt;br&gt; It runs through my heart and soul&lt;br&gt; It's deep when I'm thristy and warm when I'm cold&lt;br&gt; And when I feel forgotten I come runnin' to your shore&lt;br&gt; And find peace of mind time after time&lt;br&gt; You give me everything and more</Lyrics>

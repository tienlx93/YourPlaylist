    <Lyrics>&quot;All Of Me&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 1:]&lt;br&gt; What would I do without your smart mouth&lt;br&gt; Drawing me in, and you kicking me out&lt;br&gt; Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down&lt;br&gt; What's going on in that beautiful mind&lt;br&gt; I'm on your magical mystery ride&lt;br&gt; And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge:]&lt;br&gt; My head's under water&lt;br&gt; But I'm breathing fine&lt;br&gt; You're crazy and I'm out of my mind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; 'Cause all of me&lt;br&gt; Loves all of you&lt;br&gt; Love your curves and all your edges&lt;br&gt; All your perfect imperfections&lt;br&gt; Give your all to me&lt;br&gt; I'll give my all to you&lt;br&gt; You're my end and my beginning&lt;br&gt; Even when I lose I'm winning&lt;br&gt; 'Cause I give you all, all of me&lt;br&gt; And you give me all, all of you, oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2:]&lt;br&gt; How many times do I have to tell you&lt;br&gt; Even when you're crying you're beautiful too&lt;br&gt; The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood&lt;br&gt; You're my downfall, you're my muse&lt;br&gt; My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues&lt;br&gt; I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge:]&lt;br&gt; My head's under water&lt;br&gt; But I'm breathing fine&lt;br&gt; You're crazy and I'm out of my mind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; 'Cause all of me&lt;br&gt; Loves all of you&lt;br&gt; Love your curves and all your edges&lt;br&gt; All your perfect imperfections&lt;br&gt; Give your all to me&lt;br&gt; I'll give my all to you&lt;br&gt; You're my end and my beginning&lt;br&gt; Even when I lose I'm winning&lt;br&gt; 'Cause I give you all of me&lt;br&gt; And you give me all, all of you, oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Give me all of you&lt;br&gt; Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts&lt;br&gt; Risking it all, though it's hard&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; 'Cause all of me&lt;br&gt; Loves all of you&lt;br&gt; Love your curves and all your edges&lt;br&gt; All your perfect imperfections&lt;br&gt; Give your all to me&lt;br&gt; I'll give my all to you&lt;br&gt; You're my end and my beginning&lt;br&gt; Even when I lose I'm winning&lt;br&gt; 'Cause I give you all of me&lt;br&gt; And you give me all of you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I give you all, all of me&lt;br&gt; And you give me all, all of you, oh</Lyrics>

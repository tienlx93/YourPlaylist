    <Lyrics>When every hour could be the last&lt;br&gt; Why would we wait&lt;br&gt; Why would we wait&lt;br&gt; And every road could be unsafe&lt;br&gt; But we'll be okay&lt;br&gt; We'll make it&lt;br&gt; We'll make it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's just who we are&lt;br&gt; Say where to go&lt;br&gt; And I know that I won't slow down&lt;br&gt; It's just who we are&lt;br&gt; And we will do anything we dream about&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; How about now?&lt;br&gt; How about now?&lt;br&gt; How about now?&lt;br&gt; How about now?</Lyrics>

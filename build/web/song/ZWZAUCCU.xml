    <Lyrics>Do you know what's worth fighting for?&lt;br&gt; When it's not worth dying for?&lt;br&gt; Does it take your breath away and you feel yourself suffocating?&lt;br&gt; Does the pain weigh out the pride?&lt;br&gt; And you look for a place to hide?&lt;br&gt; Did someone break your heart inside,you're in ruins&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One, 21 Guns&lt;br&gt; Lay down your arms&lt;br&gt; Give up the fight&lt;br&gt; One, 21 Guns&lt;br&gt; Throw up your arms into the sky&lt;br&gt; You and I ...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When you're at the end of the road&lt;br&gt; And you lost all sense of control&lt;br&gt; And your thoughts have taken their toll&lt;br&gt; When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul&lt;br&gt; Your faith walks on broken glass and the hangover doesn't pass&lt;br&gt; Nothing's ever built to last, you're in ruins&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One, 21 Guns&lt;br&gt; Lay down your arms&lt;br&gt; Give up the fight&lt;br&gt; One, 21 Guns&lt;br&gt; Throw up your arms into the sky&lt;br&gt; You and I ...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Did you try to live on your own?&lt;br&gt; When you burned down the house and home?&lt;br&gt; Did you stand too close to the fire?&lt;br&gt; Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone&lt;br&gt; When it's time to live and let die&lt;br&gt; And you can't get another try&lt;br&gt; Something inside this heart has died,you're in ruins&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One, 21 Guns&lt;br&gt; Lay down your arms&lt;br&gt; Give up the fight&lt;br&gt; One, 21 Guns&lt;br&gt; Throw up your arms into the sky&lt;br&gt; You and I ...</Lyrics>

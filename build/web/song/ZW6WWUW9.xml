    <Lyrics>She's just a girl, and she's on fire&lt;br&gt; Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway&lt;br&gt; She's living in a world, and it's on fire&lt;br&gt; Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, she got both feet on the ground&lt;br&gt; And she's burning it down&lt;br&gt; Oh, she got her head in the clouds&lt;br&gt; And she's not backing down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This girl is on fire&lt;br&gt; This girl is on fire&lt;br&gt; She's walking on fire&lt;br&gt; This girl is on fire&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Looks like a girl, but she's a flame&lt;br&gt; So bright, she can burn your eyes&lt;br&gt; Better look the other way&lt;br&gt; You can try but you'll never forget her name&lt;br&gt; She's on top of the world&lt;br&gt; Hottest of the hottest girls say&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, we got our feet on the ground&lt;br&gt; And we're burning it down&lt;br&gt; Oh, got our head in the clouds&lt;br&gt; And we're not coming down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This girl is on fire&lt;br&gt; This girl is on fire&lt;br&gt; She's walking on fire&lt;br&gt; This girl is on fire&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Everybody stands, as she goes by&lt;br&gt; Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes&lt;br&gt; Watch her when she's lighting up the night&lt;br&gt; Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl&lt;br&gt; And it's a lonely world&lt;br&gt; But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This girl is on fire&lt;br&gt; This girl is on fire&lt;br&gt; She's walking on fire&lt;br&gt; This girl is on fire&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, oh, oh...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; She's just a girl, and she's on fire&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

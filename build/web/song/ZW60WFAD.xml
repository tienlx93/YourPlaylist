    <Lyrics>Every night in my dreams&lt;br&gt; I see you, I feel you,&lt;br&gt; That is how I know you go on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Far across the distance&lt;br&gt; And spaces between us&lt;br&gt; You have come to show you go on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Near, far, wherever you are&lt;br&gt; I believe that the heart does go on&lt;br&gt; Once more you open the door&lt;br&gt; And you're here in my heart&lt;br&gt; And my heart will go on and on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Love can touch us one time&lt;br&gt; And last for a lifetime&lt;br&gt; And never let go till we're gone&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Love was when I loved you&lt;br&gt; One true time I hold to&lt;br&gt; In my life we'll always go on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Near, far, wherever you are&lt;br&gt; I believe that the heart does go on&lt;br&gt; Once more you open the door&lt;br&gt; And you're here in my heart&lt;br&gt; And my heart will go on and on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You're here, there's nothing I fear,&lt;br&gt; And I know that my heart will go on&lt;br&gt; We'll stay forever this way&lt;br&gt; You are safe in my heart&lt;br&gt; And my heart will go on and on</Lyrics>

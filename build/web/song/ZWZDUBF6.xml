    <Lyrics>Home&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [originally performed by Michael Buble]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Another summer day has come and gone away&lt;br&gt; In Paris and Rome&lt;br&gt; But I want to go home&lt;br&gt; May be surrounded by a million people I,&lt;br&gt; Still feel all alone&lt;br&gt; I want to go home&lt;br&gt; Oh, I miss you, you know&lt;br&gt; And I've been keeping all the letters that I &lt;br&gt; wrote to you&lt;br&gt; Each one a line or two&lt;br&gt; I'm fine baby, how are you&lt;br&gt; I would send 'em but I know that it's just not enough&lt;br&gt; My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that&lt;br&gt; Another airplane, another sunny place&lt;br&gt; I'm lucky I know, but I wanna go home&lt;br&gt; I've got to home&lt;br&gt; Let me go home&lt;br&gt; I'm just to far from where you are, I want to come home&lt;br&gt; And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life&lt;br&gt; It's like I just stepped outside when everything was going right&lt;br&gt; And I know just why you could not come along with me&lt;br&gt; This was not your dream&lt;br&gt; But you always believed in me&lt;br&gt; Another winter day has come and gone away&lt;br&gt; In even Paris and Rome&lt;br&gt; And I wanna go home,&lt;br&gt; Let me go home&lt;br&gt; And I'm surrounded by a million people I,&lt;br&gt; Still feel alone and I want to go home&lt;br&gt; Oh, I miss you, you know&lt;br&gt; Let me go home&lt;br&gt; I've had my run,&lt;br&gt; Baby I'm done&lt;br&gt; I'm coming back home&lt;br&gt; Let me go home&lt;br&gt; It'll all be alright,&lt;br&gt; I'll be home tonight&lt;br&gt; I'm coming back home &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

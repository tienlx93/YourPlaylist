    <Lyrics>When the rain is blowing in your face,&lt;br&gt; And the whole world is on your case,&lt;br&gt; I could offer you a warm embrace&lt;br&gt; To make you feel my love.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When the evening shadows and the stars appear,&lt;br&gt; And there is no one there to dry your tears,&lt;br&gt; I could hold you for a million years&lt;br&gt; To make you feel my love.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I know you haven't made your mind up yet,&lt;br&gt; But I would never do you wrong.&lt;br&gt; I've known it from the moment that we met,&lt;br&gt; No doubt in my mind where you belong.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,&lt;br&gt; I'd go crawling down the avenue.&lt;br&gt; No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do&lt;br&gt; To make you feel my love.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The storms are raging on the rolling sea&lt;br&gt; And on the highway of regret.&lt;br&gt; Though winds of change are throwing wild and free,&lt;br&gt; You ain't seen nothing like me yet.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.&lt;br&gt; Nothing that I wouldn't do.&lt;br&gt; Go to the ends of the Earth for you,&lt;br&gt; To make you feel my love&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

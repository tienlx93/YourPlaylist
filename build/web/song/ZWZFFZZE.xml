    <Lyrics>I'm at a payphone trying to call home&lt;br&gt; All of my change I spent on you&lt;br&gt; Where have the times gone&lt;br&gt; Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember&lt;br&gt; The people we used to be&lt;br&gt; It's even harder to picture&lt;br&gt; That you're not here next to me&lt;br&gt; You say it's too late to make it&lt;br&gt; But is it too late to try?&lt;br&gt; And in our time that you wasted&lt;br&gt; All of our bridges burned down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've wasted my nights&lt;br&gt; You turned out the lights&lt;br&gt; Now I'm paralyzed&lt;br&gt; Still stuck in that time when we called it love&lt;br&gt; But even the sun sets in paradise&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm at a payphone trying to call home&lt;br&gt; All of my change I spent on you&lt;br&gt; Where have the times gone&lt;br&gt; Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If happy ever after did exist&lt;br&gt; I would still be holding you like this&lt;br&gt; All those fairytales are full of sh*t&lt;br&gt; One more stupid love song I'll be sick&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You turned your back on tomorrow&lt;br&gt; Cause you forgot yesterday&lt;br&gt; I gave you my love to borrow&lt;br&gt; But just gave it away&lt;br&gt; You can't expect me to be fine&lt;br&gt; I don't expect you to care&lt;br&gt; I know I've said it before&lt;br&gt; But all of our bridges burned down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've wasted my nights&lt;br&gt; You turned out the lights&lt;br&gt; Now I'm paralyzed&lt;br&gt; Still stucked in that time when we called it love&lt;br&gt; But even the sun sets in paradise&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm at a payphone trying to call home&lt;br&gt; All of my change I spent on you&lt;br&gt; Where have the times gone&lt;br&gt; Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If happy ever after did exist&lt;br&gt; I would still be holding you like this&lt;br&gt; All those fairytales are full of sh*t&lt;br&gt; One more stupid love song I'll be sick&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now I'm at a payphone...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Wiz Khalifa]&lt;br&gt; Man work that sh*t&lt;br&gt; I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round&lt;br&gt; Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing&lt;br&gt; Made it from the bottom&lt;br&gt; Now when you see me I'm stunning&lt;br&gt; And all of my cars start with the push up a button&lt;br&gt; Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it&lt;br&gt; Switched the number to my phone&lt;br&gt; So you never could call it&lt;br&gt; Don't need my name on my show&lt;br&gt; You can tell it I'm ballin'&lt;br&gt; Swish, what a shame could have got picked&lt;br&gt; Had a really good game but you missed your last shot&lt;br&gt; So you talk about who you see at the top&lt;br&gt; Or what you could've saw&lt;br&gt; But sad to say it's over for&lt;br&gt; Phantom pulled up valet open doors&lt;br&gt; Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for&lt;br&gt; Now ask me who they want&lt;br&gt; So you can go and take that little piece of sh*t with you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm at a payphone trying to call home&lt;br&gt; All of my change I spent on you&lt;br&gt; Where have the times gone&lt;br&gt; Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If happy ever after did exist&lt;br&gt; I would still be holding you like this&lt;br&gt; All those fairytales are full of sh*t&lt;br&gt; One more stupid love song I'll be sick&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now I'm at a payphone...</Lyrics>

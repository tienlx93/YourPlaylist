    <Lyrics>I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two&lt;br&gt; But it turned into a party when I started talking to you&lt;br&gt; Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on&lt;br&gt; Baby it's your call, no pressure at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter&lt;br&gt; And lean a little closer&lt;br&gt; You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild&lt;br&gt; And when the night is almost over&lt;br&gt; Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat&lt;br&gt; And do a little bit of country song, hanging on&lt;br&gt; You don't have to keep me falling like this&lt;br&gt; But it'd sure be cool if you did&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can't shoot me down cause you've already knocked me dead&lt;br&gt; Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head&lt;br&gt; Let your mind take a little back road just as far as you wanna go&lt;br&gt; Baby, I'll do, whatever you wanna do, wanna do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter&lt;br&gt; And lean a little closer&lt;br&gt; You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild&lt;br&gt; And when the night is almost over&lt;br&gt; Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat&lt;br&gt; And do a little bit of country song, hanging on&lt;br&gt; You don't have to keep me falling like this&lt;br&gt; But it'd sure be cool if you did&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Have a night that you'll never forget&lt;br&gt; And now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter&lt;br&gt; And lean a little closer&lt;br&gt; You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild&lt;br&gt; And when the night is almost over&lt;br&gt; Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat&lt;br&gt; And do a little bit of country song, hanging on&lt;br&gt; You don't have to keep me falling like this&lt;br&gt; But it'd sure be cool if you did&lt;br&gt; Yeah, it'd sure be cool if you did</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Memories consume&lt;br&gt; Like opening the wound&lt;br&gt; I'm picking me apart again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You all assume&lt;br&gt; I'm safe here in my room&lt;br&gt; Unless I try to start again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't want to be the one&lt;br&gt; The battles always choose&lt;br&gt; 'Cause inside I realize&lt;br&gt; That I'm the one confused&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't know what's worth fighting for&lt;br&gt; Or why I have to scream&lt;br&gt; I don't know why I instigate&lt;br&gt; And say what I don't mean&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't know how I got this way&lt;br&gt; I know it's not alright&lt;br&gt; So I'm breaking the habit&lt;br&gt; I'm breaking the habit tonight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Clutching my cure&lt;br&gt; I tightly lock the door&lt;br&gt; I try to catch my breath again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I hurt much more&lt;br&gt; Than anytime before&lt;br&gt; I had no options left again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't want to be the one&lt;br&gt; The battles always choose&lt;br&gt; 'Cause inside I realize&lt;br&gt; That I'm the one confused&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't know what's worth fighting for&lt;br&gt; Or why I have to scream&lt;br&gt; I don't know why I instigate&lt;br&gt; And say what I don't mean&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't know how I got this way&lt;br&gt; I'll never be alright&lt;br&gt; So I'm breaking the habit&lt;br&gt; I'm breaking the habit tonight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll paint it on the walls&lt;br&gt; 'Cause I'm the one at fault&lt;br&gt; I'll never fight again&lt;br&gt; And this is how it ends&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't know what's worth fighting for&lt;br&gt; Or why I have to scream&lt;br&gt; But now I have some clarity&lt;br&gt; To show you what I mean&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't know how I got this way&lt;br&gt; I'll never be alright&lt;br&gt; So I'm breaking the habit&lt;br&gt; I'm breaking the habit&lt;br&gt; I'm breaking the habit tonight</Lyrics>

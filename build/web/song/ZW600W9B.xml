    <Lyrics>I've tried playing it cool&lt;br&gt; But when I'm looking at you&lt;br&gt; I can’t ever be brave&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you make my heart race&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Shot me out of the sky&lt;br&gt; You're my kryptonite&lt;br&gt; You keep making me weak&lt;br&gt; Yeah, frozen and can't breathe&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Something’s gotta give now&lt;br&gt; 'Cause I’m dying just to make you see&lt;br&gt; That I need you here with me now&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you've got that one thing&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So get out, get out, get out of my head&lt;br&gt; And fall into my arms instead&lt;br&gt; I don't, I don't, don't know what it is&lt;br&gt; But I need that one thing&lt;br&gt; And you've got that one thing&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now I'm climbing the walls&lt;br&gt; But you don't notice at all&lt;br&gt; That I'm going out of my mind&lt;br&gt; All day and all night&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Something’s gotta give now&lt;br&gt; 'Cause I'm dying just to know your name&lt;br&gt; And I need you here with me now&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you've got that one thing&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So get out, get out, get out of my head&lt;br&gt; And fall into my arms instead&lt;br&gt; I don't, I don't, don't know what it is&lt;br&gt; But I need that one thing&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So get out, get out, get out of my mind&lt;br&gt; And come on, come into my life&lt;br&gt; I don't, I don't, don't know what it is&lt;br&gt; But I need that one thing&lt;br&gt; And you've got that one thing&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You've got that one thing&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Get out, get out, get out of my head&lt;br&gt; And fall into my arms instead&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So get out, get out, get out of my head &lt;br&gt; And fall into my arms instead&lt;br&gt; I don't, I don't, don't know what it is&lt;br&gt; But I need that one thing&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So get out, get out, get out of my mind&lt;br&gt; And come on, come into my life&lt;br&gt; I don't, I don't, don't know what it is&lt;br&gt; But I need that one thing&lt;br&gt; And you've got that one thing</Lyrics>

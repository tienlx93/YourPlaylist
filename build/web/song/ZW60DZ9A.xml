    <Lyrics>I'm tired of being what you want me to be&lt;br&gt; Feeling so faithless lost under the surface&lt;br&gt; Don't know what you're expecting of me&lt;br&gt; Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes&lt;br&gt; (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)&lt;br&gt; Every step that I take is another mistake to you&lt;br&gt; (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I've become so numb I can't feel you there&lt;br&gt; I've become so tired so much more aware&lt;br&gt; I'm becoming this all I want to do&lt;br&gt; Is be more like me and be less like you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Can't you see that you're smothering me&lt;br&gt; Holding too tightly afraid to lose control&lt;br&gt; Cause everything that you thought I would be&lt;br&gt; Has fallen apart right in front of you&lt;br&gt; (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)&lt;br&gt; Every step that I take is another mistake to you&lt;br&gt; (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)&lt;br&gt; And every second I waste is more than I can take&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I've become so numb I can't feel you there&lt;br&gt; I've become so tired so much more aware&lt;br&gt; I'm becoming this all I want to do&lt;br&gt; Is be more like me and be less like you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I know&lt;br&gt; I may end up failing too&lt;br&gt; But I know&lt;br&gt; You were just like me with someone disappointed in you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I've become so numb I can't feel you there&lt;br&gt; I've become so tired so much more aware&lt;br&gt; I'm becoming this all I want to do&lt;br&gt; Is be more like me and be less like you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I've become so numb I can't feel you there&lt;br&gt; I'm tired of being what you want me to be&lt;br&gt; I've become so numb I can't feel you there&lt;br&gt; I'm tired of being what you want me to be.</Lyrics>

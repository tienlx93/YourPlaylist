    <Lyrics>let it go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; we get a little faded the colours go&lt;br&gt; running out of all our clothes&lt;br&gt; and the flash don’t light when the battery's low&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; when you could stamp a foot down through the floor&lt;br&gt; it's a better plan by far&lt;br&gt; to blow off the roof and let in the dark&lt;br&gt; so we better get started&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; and if i were you, i’d let it go&lt;br&gt; and feel it all over inside like a chemical&lt;br&gt; cause to tell the truth i don’t know&lt;br&gt; if it’s ever over&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (chorus)&lt;br&gt; we don’t need a cure for the weight of the world&lt;br&gt; cause it’s floating round in the universe&lt;br&gt; just swinging like it’s tied by a string that you own&lt;br&gt; let it go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; we could dig a hole right down into&lt;br&gt; somewhere it’s deep as black and blue&lt;br&gt; and fill it with a crowd and the sound of right now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; and we could carve a tunnel under&lt;br&gt; and find out just how low it goes, it goes&lt;br&gt; and we run out of dirt on the other side when we see the light&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; and if i were you, i’d look up&lt;br&gt; and find a place there in the sky where there’s room enough&lt;br&gt; to spread it out, and out now&lt;br&gt; the greater than when you come down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (chorus)&lt;br&gt; we don’t need a cure for the weight of the world&lt;br&gt; cause it’s floating round in the universe&lt;br&gt; just swinging like it’s tied by a string that you own&lt;br&gt; let it go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; let it go&lt;br&gt; let it go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; when you could stamp a foot down through the floor&lt;br&gt; it's a better plan by far&lt;br&gt; to go off the roof and let in the dark, let in the dark, dark, dark&lt;br&gt; so we better get started, started, started&lt;br&gt; yeah we better get started, started, started&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (chorus)&lt;br&gt; we don’t need a cure for the weight of the world&lt;br&gt; cause it’s floating round in the universe&lt;br&gt; just swinging like it’s tied by a string that you own&lt;br&gt; let it go&lt;br&gt; let it go&lt;br&gt; let it go&lt;br&gt; let it go</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>When We Stand Together&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One more depending on a prayer&lt;br&gt; And we all look away&lt;br&gt; People pretending everywhere&lt;br&gt; It's just another day&lt;br&gt; There's bullets flying through the air&lt;br&gt; And they still carry on&lt;br&gt; We watch it happen over there&lt;br&gt; And then just turn it off&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; We must stand together&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; There's no giving in&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; Hand in hand forever&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; That's when we all win&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; That's, that's, that's when we all win&lt;br&gt; That's, that's, that's when we all win&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; They tell us everything's alright&lt;br&gt; And we just go along&lt;br&gt; How can we fall asleep at night&lt;br&gt; When something's clearly wrong&lt;br&gt; When we could feed a starving world&lt;br&gt; With what we throw away&lt;br&gt; But all we serve are empty words&lt;br&gt; That always taste the same&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; We must stand together&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; There's no giving in&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; Hand in hand forever&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; That's when we all win&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; That's, that's, that's when we all win&lt;br&gt; That's, that's, that's when we all win&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The right thing to guide us&lt;br&gt; Is right here inside us&lt;br&gt; No one can divide us&lt;br&gt; When the light is nearly gone&lt;br&gt; But just like a heartbeat&lt;br&gt; The drumbeat carries on&lt;br&gt; And the drumbeat carries on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; We must stand together&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; There's no giving in&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; Hand in hand forever&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; That's when we all win&lt;br&gt; Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah&lt;br&gt; That's, that's, that's when we all win&lt;br&gt; That's, that's, that's when we all win</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Dry lightning cracks across the skies &lt;br&gt; Those storm clouds gather in her eyes&lt;br&gt; Her daddy was a mean old mister&lt;br&gt; Mama was an angel in the ground&lt;br&gt; The weatherman called for a twister &lt;br&gt; She prayed blow it down There's not enough rain in Oklahoma&lt;br&gt; To wash the sins out of that house There's not enough wind in Oklahoma &lt;br&gt; To rip the nails out of the past&lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Shatter every window till it's all blown away&lt;br&gt; Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away&lt;br&gt; Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday &lt;br&gt; Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away (Blown away) &lt;br&gt; She heard the sirens screaming out Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch &lt;br&gt; She locked herself in the cellar Listened to the screaming of the wind &lt;br&gt; Some people called the take-in shelter &lt;br&gt; She called a sweet revenge &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Shatter every window till it's all blown away &lt;br&gt; Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away &lt;br&gt; Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday&lt;br&gt; Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away &lt;br&gt; Blown away There's not enough rain in Oklahoma &lt;br&gt; To wash the sings out of that house &lt;br&gt; There's not enough wind in Oklahoma &lt;br&gt; To rip the nails out of the past &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Shatter every window till it's all blown away &lt;br&gt; Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away &lt;br&gt; Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday &lt;br&gt; Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away &lt;br&gt; Blown away Blown away Blown away Blown away Blown away</Lyrics>

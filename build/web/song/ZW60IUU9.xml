    <Lyrics>I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore&lt;br&gt; I hope that I've learned this time&lt;br&gt; I hope that I find what I'm reaching for&lt;br&gt; The way that it is in my mind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Someday I'll get over you&lt;br&gt; I'll live to see it all through&lt;br&gt; But I'll always miss&lt;br&gt; Dreaming my dreams with you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I won't let it change me&lt;br&gt; Not if I can&lt;br&gt; I'd rather believe in love&lt;br&gt; And give it away&lt;br&gt; As much as I can&lt;br&gt; To those that I'm fondest of&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Someday I'll get over you&lt;br&gt; I'll live to see it all through&lt;br&gt; But I'll always miss&lt;br&gt; Dreaming my dreams with you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Someday I'll get over you&lt;br&gt; I'll live to see it all through&lt;br&gt; But I'll always miss&lt;br&gt; Dreaming my dreams with you</Lyrics>

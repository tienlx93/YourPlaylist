    <Lyrics>&lt;br&gt; [Verse 1]&lt;br&gt; I'm holdin' on your rope,&lt;br&gt; Got me ten feet off the ground.&lt;br&gt; And I'm hearin' what you say,&lt;br&gt; But I just can't make a sound.&lt;br&gt; You tell me that you need me,&lt;br&gt; Then you go and cut me down...&lt;br&gt; But wait...&lt;br&gt; You tell me that you're sorry,&lt;br&gt; Didn't think I'd turn around...&lt;br&gt; And say...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; That it's too late to apologize.&lt;br&gt; It's too late...&lt;br&gt; I said it's too late to apologize.&lt;br&gt; It's too late.&lt;br&gt; Yeah!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2]&lt;br&gt; I'd take another chance,&lt;br&gt; Take a fall, take a shot for you.&lt;br&gt; I need you like a heart needs a beat,&lt;br&gt; But it's nothin' new.&lt;br&gt; I loved you with a fire red,&lt;br&gt; Now it's turnin' blue...&lt;br&gt; And you say...&lt;br&gt; Sorry, like an angel&lt;br&gt; Heaven let me think was you...&lt;br&gt; But I'm afraid...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; It's too late to apologize.&lt;br&gt; It's too late.&lt;br&gt; I said it's too late to apologize.&lt;br&gt; It's too late.&lt;br&gt; Whoa!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Interlude]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; It's too late to apologize.&lt;br&gt; It's too late.&lt;br&gt; I said it's too late to apologize.&lt;br&gt; It's too late.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I said it's too to apologize. YEAH!&lt;br&gt; I said it's too late to apologize. YEAH!&lt;br&gt; I'm holdin' on your rope,&lt;br&gt; got me ten feet off the ground.</Lyrics>

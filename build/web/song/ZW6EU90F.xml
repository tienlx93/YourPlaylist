    <Lyrics>know I took the path&lt;br&gt; That you would never want for me&lt;br&gt; I know I let you down, didn't I?&lt;br&gt; So many sleepless nights&lt;br&gt; Where you were waiting up on me&lt;br&gt; Well I'm just a slave unto the night&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now remember when I told you&lt;br&gt; That's the last you'll see of me?&lt;br&gt; Remember when I broke you down to tears?&lt;br&gt; I know I took the path&lt;br&gt; That you would never want for me&lt;br&gt; I gave you hell through all the years&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I, I bet my life, I bet my life&lt;br&gt; I bet my life on you&lt;br&gt; I, I bet my life, I bet my life&lt;br&gt; I bet my life on you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've been around the world&lt;br&gt; And never in my wildest dreams&lt;br&gt; Would I come running home to you&lt;br&gt; I've told a million lies&lt;br&gt; But now I tell a single truth&lt;br&gt; There's you in everything I do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now remember when I told you&lt;br&gt; That's the last you'll see of me?&lt;br&gt; Remember when I broke you down to tears?&lt;br&gt; I know I took the path&lt;br&gt; That you would never want for me&lt;br&gt; I gave you hell through all the years&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I, I bet my life, I bet my life&lt;br&gt; I bet my life on you&lt;br&gt; I, I bet my life, I bet my life&lt;br&gt; I bet my life on you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Don't tell me that I'm wrong&lt;br&gt; I've walked that road before&lt;br&gt; And left you on your own&lt;br&gt; And please believe them when they say&lt;br&gt; That it's left for yesterday&lt;br&gt; And the records that I've played&lt;br&gt; Please forgive me for all&lt;br&gt; I've done&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I, I bet my life, I bet my life&lt;br&gt; I bet my life on you&lt;br&gt; I, I bet my life, I bet my life&lt;br&gt; I bet my life on you</Lyrics>

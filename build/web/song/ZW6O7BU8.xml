    <Lyrics>All along it was a fever&lt;br&gt; A cold sweat hot-headed believer&lt;br&gt; I threw my hands in the air I said show me something&lt;br&gt; He said, if you dare come a little closer&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Round and around and around and around we go&lt;br&gt; Ohhh now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now, you know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Not really sure how to feel about it&lt;br&gt; Something in the way you move&lt;br&gt; Makes me feel like I can't live without you&lt;br&gt; It takes me all the way&lt;br&gt; I want you to stay&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's not much of a life you're living&lt;br&gt; It's not just something you take, it's given&lt;br&gt; Round and around and around and around we go&lt;br&gt; Ohhh now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now, you know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Not really sure how to feel about it&lt;br&gt; Something in the way you move&lt;br&gt; Makes me feel like I can't live without you&lt;br&gt; It takes me all the way&lt;br&gt; I want you to stay&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ohhh the reason I hold on&lt;br&gt; Ohhh cause I need this hole gone&lt;br&gt; Funny you're the broken one but i'm the only one who needed saving&lt;br&gt; Cause when you never see the lights it's hard to know which one of us is caving&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Not really sure how to feel about it&lt;br&gt; Something in the way you move&lt;br&gt; Makes me feel like I can't live without you&lt;br&gt; It takes me all the way&lt;br&gt; I want you to stay, stay&lt;br&gt; I want you to stay, ohhh</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>The best thing about tonight's that we're not fighting&lt;br&gt; Could it be that we have been this way before&lt;br&gt; I know you don't think that I am trying&lt;br&gt; I know you're wearing thin down to the core&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But hold your breath&lt;br&gt; Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you&lt;br&gt; Over again&lt;br&gt; Don't make me change my mind&lt;br&gt; Or I wont live to see another day&lt;br&gt; I swear it's true&lt;br&gt; Because a girl like you is impossible to find&lt;br&gt; You're impossible to find&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This is not what I intended&lt;br&gt; I always swore to you I'd never fall apart&lt;br&gt; You always thought that I was stronger&lt;br&gt; I may have failed&lt;br&gt; But I have loved you from the start&lt;br&gt; Oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But hold your breath&lt;br&gt; Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you&lt;br&gt; Over again&lt;br&gt; Don't make me change my mind&lt;br&gt; Or I wont live to see another day&lt;br&gt; I swear it's true&lt;br&gt; Because a girl like you is impossible to find&lt;br&gt; It's impossible&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So breathe in so deep&lt;br&gt; Breathe me in&lt;br&gt; I'm yours to keep&lt;br&gt; And hold onto your words&lt;br&gt; Cause talk is cheap&lt;br&gt; And remember me tonight&lt;br&gt; When your asleep&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you&lt;br&gt; Over again&lt;br&gt; Don't make me change my mind&lt;br&gt; Or I wont live to see another day&lt;br&gt; I swear it's true&lt;br&gt; Because a girl like you is impossible to find&lt;br&gt; Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you&lt;br&gt; Over again&lt;br&gt; Don't make me change my mind&lt;br&gt; Or I wont live to see another day&lt;br&gt; I swear it's true&lt;br&gt; Because a girl like you is impossible to find&lt;br&gt; You're impossible to find</Lyrics>

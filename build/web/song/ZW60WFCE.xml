    <Lyrics>You're just too good to be true.&lt;br&gt; Can't take my eyes off you.&lt;br&gt; You'd be like heaven to touch.&lt;br&gt; I wanna hold you so much.&lt;br&gt; At long last love has arrived.&lt;br&gt; And I thank God I'm alive.&lt;br&gt; You're just too good to be true.&lt;br&gt; Can't take my eyes off you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Pardon the way that I stare.&lt;br&gt; There's nothing else to compare.&lt;br&gt; The sight of you leaves me weak.&lt;br&gt; There are no words left to speak.&lt;br&gt; But if you feel like I feel.&lt;br&gt; Please let me know that it's real.&lt;br&gt; You're just too good to be true.&lt;br&gt; Can't take my eyes off you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I love you baby, and if it's quite all right,&lt;br&gt; I need you baby to warm a lonely night.&lt;br&gt; I love you baby. Trust in me when I say&lt;br&gt; Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray.&lt;br&gt; Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.&lt;br&gt; And let me love you,baby&lt;br&gt; let me love you</Lyrics>

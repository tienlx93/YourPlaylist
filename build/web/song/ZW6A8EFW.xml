    <Lyrics>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight&lt;br&gt; Not a footprint to be seen&lt;br&gt; A kingdom of isolation&lt;br&gt; And it looks like I'm the queen&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside&lt;br&gt; Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried&lt;br&gt; Don't let them in, don't let them see&lt;br&gt; Be the good girl you always have to be&lt;br&gt; Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know&lt;br&gt; Well, now they know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Can't hold it back anymore&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Turn away and slam the door&lt;br&gt; I don't care what they're going to say&lt;br&gt; Let the storm rage on&lt;br&gt; The cold never bothered me anyway&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small&lt;br&gt; And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all&lt;br&gt; It's time to see what I can do&lt;br&gt; To test the limits and break through&lt;br&gt; No right, no wrong, no rules for me&lt;br&gt; I'm free&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; I am one with the wind and sky&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; You'll never see me cry&lt;br&gt; Here I stand and here I'll stay&lt;br&gt; Let the storm rage on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; My power flurries through the air into the ground&lt;br&gt; My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around&lt;br&gt; And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast&lt;br&gt; I'm never going back, the past is in the past&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; And I'll rise like the break of dawn&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; That perfect girl is gone&lt;br&gt; Here I stand in the light of day&lt;br&gt; Let the storm rage on&lt;br&gt; The cold never bothered me anyway&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Can't hold it back anymore&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Turn my back and slam the door&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The snow glows white on the mountain tonight&lt;br&gt; Not a footprint to be seen&lt;br&gt; A kingdom of isolation&lt;br&gt; And it looks like I'm the queen&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside&lt;br&gt; Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried&lt;br&gt; Don't let them in, don't let them see&lt;br&gt; Be the good girl you always had to be&lt;br&gt; Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know&lt;br&gt; Well, now they know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Can't hold it back anymore&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Turn my back and slam the door&lt;br&gt; And here I stand, and here I'll stay&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; The cold never bothered me anyway&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small&lt;br&gt; And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all&lt;br&gt; Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe&lt;br&gt; I know I left a life behind, but I'm too relieved to grieve&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Can't hold it back anymore&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Turn my back and slam the door&lt;br&gt; And here I stand, and here I'll stay&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; The cold never bothered me anyway&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Standing frozen in the life I've chosen&lt;br&gt; You won't find me, the past is so behind me&lt;br&gt; Buried in the snow&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Can't hold it back anymore&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Turn my back and slam the door&lt;br&gt; And here I stand, and here I'll stay&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; The cold never bothered me anyway, oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go&lt;br&gt; Yeah, yeah&lt;br&gt; Na, na&lt;br&gt; Here I'll stay&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Ooh&lt;br&gt; Let it go</Lyrics>

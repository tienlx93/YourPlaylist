    <Lyrics>I was bound, was tired&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hadn't seen a light for so long&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Thought I lost my fight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Couldn't find my way back home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I found a light snapping out of me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I was bound, and tired&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Waiting for daylight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bang my head against the wall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I will rise above it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Found what I was searching for&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Though I feel light headed&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I should have failed, and nailed the floor&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Instead I rose above it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bang my head against the wall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Instead I rose above it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (Bang my head against the wall)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When you think you're giving up&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just know, you might think you're dying but you won't&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And you the feel the love, something out of you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But when you think of giving up, don't&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bang your head against the wall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You may feel light headed&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But you won't crawl, no, you won't fall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You will rise above it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You'll find what you're searching for&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And you may feel light headed&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You think you're gonna hit the floor&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Instead you rise above it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bang your head against the wall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Instead you rise above it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I have broken wings&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I keep trying, keep trying&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; No I wont give up&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh I'm flying, oh I'm flying&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bang my head against the wall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I will rise above it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Found what I was searching for&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Though I feel light headed&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I should have failed, and nailed the floor&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Instead I rose above it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bang my head against the wall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bang my head against the wall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bang my head against the wall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Instead I rise above it all</Lyrics>

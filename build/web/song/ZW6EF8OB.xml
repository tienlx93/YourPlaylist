    <Lyrics>[Verse 1:]&lt;br&gt; Am I just a fool?&lt;br&gt; Blind and stupid for loving you&lt;br&gt; Am I just a silly girl?&lt;br&gt; So young and naive to think you were the one who came to take claim of this heart&lt;br&gt; Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; And now the people are talking, the people are saying&lt;br&gt; that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano&lt;br&gt; The people are talking, the people are saying&lt;br&gt; that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano&lt;br&gt; So play on, play on, play on&lt;br&gt; Play on, play on, play on&lt;br&gt; Play on, play on, play on&lt;br&gt; Play on, play on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2:]&lt;br&gt; Am I being a fool?&lt;br&gt; Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths&lt;br&gt; What do I see in you?&lt;br&gt; Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do&lt;br&gt; Cause I keep thinking you were the one who came to take claim of this heart&lt;br&gt; Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; And now the people are talking, the people are saying&lt;br&gt; that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano&lt;br&gt; The people are talking, the people are saying&lt;br&gt; that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano&lt;br&gt; So play on, play on, play on&lt;br&gt; Play on, play on, play on&lt;br&gt; Play on, play on, play on&lt;br&gt; Play on, play on</Lyrics>

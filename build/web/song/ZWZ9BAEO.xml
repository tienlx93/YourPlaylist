    <Lyrics>[Kian:]&lt;br&gt; Goodbye to you my trusted friend &lt;br&gt; We've known each other since we were nine or ten &lt;br&gt; Together we've climbed hills and trees &lt;br&gt; Learned of love and ABC's &lt;br&gt; Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bryan:]&lt;br&gt; Goodbye my friend it's hard to die &lt;br&gt; When all the birds are singing in the sky &lt;br&gt; Now that spring is in the air &lt;br&gt; Pretty girls are everywhere &lt;br&gt; Think of me and I'll be there&lt;br&gt; [All:]&lt;br&gt; We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun &lt;br&gt; But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Shane:]&lt;br&gt; Goodbye Papa please pray for me &lt;br&gt; I was the black sheep of the family &lt;br&gt; You tried to teach me right from wrong &lt;br&gt; Too much wine and too much song &lt;br&gt; Wonder how I got along &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Mark:]&lt;br&gt; Goodbye papa it's hard to die &lt;br&gt; When all the birds are singing in the sky &lt;br&gt; Now that the spring is in the air &lt;br&gt; Little children everywhere &lt;br&gt; When you see them I'll be there&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [All:]&lt;br&gt; We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun &lt;br&gt; But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone &lt;br&gt; We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun &lt;br&gt; But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Nicky:]&lt;br&gt; Goodbye Michelle my little one &lt;br&gt; You gave me love and helped me find the sun &lt;br&gt; And every time that I was down &lt;br&gt; You would always come around &lt;br&gt; And get my feet back on the ground &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Shane:]&lt;br&gt; Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die &lt;br&gt; When all the birds are singing in the sky &lt;br&gt; Now that the spring is in the air&lt;br&gt; With the flowers everywhere &lt;br&gt; I wish that we could both be there &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [All:]&lt;br&gt; We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun &lt;br&gt; But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time &lt;br&gt; We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun &lt;br&gt; But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone &lt;br&gt; We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun &lt;br&gt; But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time &lt;br&gt; We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun &lt;br&gt; But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

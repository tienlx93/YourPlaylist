    <Lyrics>I wish that this night would never be over&lt;br&gt; There’s plenty of time to sleep when we die&lt;br&gt; So let’s just stay awake until we grow older&lt;br&gt; If I had my way we’d never close our eyes, our eyes, never!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don’t wanna let a minute get away&lt;br&gt; Cause we got no time to lose&lt;br&gt; None of us are promised to see tomorrow&lt;br&gt; And what we do is ours to choose&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Forget about the sunrise&lt;br&gt; Fight the sleep in your eyes&lt;br&gt; I don’t wanna miss a second with you&lt;br&gt; Let’s stay this way forever&lt;br&gt; It’s only getting better if we want it to&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You know I wish that this night would never be over&lt;br&gt; There’s plenty of time to sleep when we die&lt;br&gt; So let’s just stay awake until we grow older&lt;br&gt; If I had my way we’d never close our eyes, our eyes, never!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's so hard to think this could fade away&lt;br&gt; But what goes up must come down&lt;br&gt; Why can't we just live life with no consequence&lt;br&gt; And always live in the now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Forget about the sunrise&lt;br&gt; Fight the sleep in your eyes&lt;br&gt; I don’t wanna miss a second with you&lt;br&gt; Let’s stay this way forever&lt;br&gt; It's only gets better if we want it to&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You know I wish that this night would never be over&lt;br&gt; There’s plenty of time to sleep when we die&lt;br&gt; So let’s just stay awake until we grow older&lt;br&gt; If I had my way we’d never close our eyes, our eyes, never&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ooooh, yeah&lt;br&gt; Ooooh, yeah, yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You know I wish that this night would never be over&lt;br&gt; There’s plenty of time to sleep when we die&lt;br&gt; So let’s just stay awake until we grow older&lt;br&gt; If I had my way we’d never close our eyes, our eyes, never</Lyrics>

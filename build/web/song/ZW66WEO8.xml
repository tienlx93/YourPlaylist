    <Lyrics>I've seen the world&lt;br&gt; Done it all, had my cake now&lt;br&gt; Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now&lt;br&gt; Hot summer nights mid July&lt;br&gt; When you and I were forever wild&lt;br&gt; The crazy days, the city lights&lt;br&gt; The way you'd play with me like a child&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful&lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul&lt;br&gt; I know you will, I know you will&lt;br&gt; I know that you will&lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now&lt;br&gt; Channeling angels in, the new age now&lt;br&gt; Hot summer days, rock and roll&lt;br&gt; The way you'd play for me at your show&lt;br&gt; And all the ways I got to know&lt;br&gt; Your pretty face and electric soul&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful&lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul&lt;br&gt; I know you will, I know you will&lt;br&gt; I know that you will&lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Dear lord when I get to heaven&lt;br&gt; Please let me bring my man&lt;br&gt; When he comes tell me that you'll let me&lt;br&gt; Father tell me if you can&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh that grace, oh that body&lt;br&gt; Oh that face makes me wanna party&lt;br&gt; He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful&lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul&lt;br&gt; I know you will, I know you will&lt;br&gt; I know that you will&lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful&lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful&lt;br&gt; Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>When you try your best, but you don't succeed&lt;br&gt; When you get what you want, but not what you need&lt;br&gt; When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep&lt;br&gt; Stuck in reverse&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And the tears come streaming down your face&lt;br&gt; When you lose something you can't replace&lt;br&gt; When you love someone, but it goes to waste&lt;br&gt; Could it be worse?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Lights will guide you home&lt;br&gt; And ignite your bones&lt;br&gt; And I will try to fix you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And high up above or down below&lt;br&gt; When you're too in love to let it go&lt;br&gt; But if you never try you'll never know&lt;br&gt; Just what you're worth&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Lights will guide you home&lt;br&gt; And ignite your bones&lt;br&gt; And I will try to fix you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Tears stream down on your face&lt;br&gt; When you lose something you cannot replace&lt;br&gt; Tears stream down on your face&lt;br&gt; And on your face I...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Tears stream down on your face&lt;br&gt; I promise you I will learn from my mistakes&lt;br&gt; Tears stream down on your face&lt;br&gt; And on your face I...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Lights will guide you home&lt;br&gt; And ignite your bones&lt;br&gt; And I will try to fix you</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>One two three&lt;br&gt; You left me but&lt;br&gt; I can hear you breathing from somewhere&lt;br&gt; Once again Four five six&lt;br&gt; Red tears are flowing&lt;br&gt; I miss your smell that once held me&lt;br&gt; You said it was for my own good&lt;br&gt; and you turned away coldly like a lie&lt;br&gt; Why did you&lt;br&gt; Why did you, you’re gone away&lt;br&gt; Come Back Home&lt;br&gt; Can you come back home&lt;br&gt; Don’t leave me at the end of this cold earth and come to me&lt;br&gt; Come back home&lt;br&gt; Can you come back home&lt;br&gt; Put all the pain in the past&lt;br&gt; I still wait for you like this&lt;br&gt; Now you gotta do what you gotta do&lt;br&gt; COME BACK HOME&lt;br&gt; COME BACK HOME&lt;br&gt; Come baby baby come come baby&lt;br&gt; Come Come baby baby come come&lt;br&gt; Come back to me&lt;br&gt; Come baby baby come come baby&lt;br&gt; Come Come baby baby come come&lt;br&gt; I hate you for not answering&lt;br&gt; Do you sometimes miss me too yeah&lt;br&gt; I am trapped in time without you&lt;br&gt; I can’t see what’s in front of me I’m so scared&lt;br&gt; I still think that many days&lt;br&gt; are waiting&lt;br&gt; Where are you&lt;br&gt; where too far away&lt;br&gt; Come Back Home&lt;br&gt; Can you come back home&lt;br&gt; Don’t leave me at the end of this cold earth and come to me&lt;br&gt; Come back home&lt;br&gt; Can you come back home&lt;br&gt; Put all the pain in the past&lt;br&gt; I still wait for you like this&lt;br&gt; Now you gotta do what you gotta do&lt;br&gt; Come back home&lt;br&gt; Come back home&lt;br&gt; Come baby baby come come baby&lt;br&gt; Come Come baby baby come come&lt;br&gt; Come back to me&lt;br&gt; Come baby baby come come baby&lt;br&gt; Come Come baby baby come come&lt;br&gt; Come Back Home&lt;br&gt; Can you come back home&lt;br&gt; Don’t leave me at the end of this cold earth and come to me&lt;br&gt; Come back home&lt;br&gt; Can you come back home&lt;br&gt; Put all the pain in the past&lt;br&gt; I still wait for you like this&lt;br&gt; Now you gotta do what you gotta do</Lyrics>

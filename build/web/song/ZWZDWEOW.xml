    <Lyrics>(When I first saw you, I saw love.&lt;br&gt; And the first time you touched me, I felt love.&lt;br&gt; And after&lt;br&gt; all this time, you're still the one I love.)&lt;br&gt; Looks like we made it&lt;br&gt; Look how far we've come my baby&lt;br&gt; We mighta took the long way&lt;br&gt; We knew we'd get there someday&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; They said, &quot;I bet they'll never make it&quot;&lt;br&gt; But just look at us holding on&lt;br&gt; We're still together still going strong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (You're still the one)&lt;br&gt; You're still the one I run to&lt;br&gt; The one that I belong to&lt;br&gt; You're still the one I want for life&lt;br&gt; (You're still the one)&lt;br&gt; You're still the one that I love&lt;br&gt; The only one I dream of&lt;br&gt; You're still the one I kiss good night&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ain't nothin' better&lt;br&gt; We beat the odds together&lt;br&gt; I'm glad we didn't listen&lt;br&gt; Look at what we would be missin'&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; They said, &quot;I bet they'll never make it&quot;&lt;br&gt; But just look at us holding on&lt;br&gt; We're still together still going strong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (You're still the one)&lt;br&gt; You're still the one I run to&lt;br&gt; The one that I belong to&lt;br&gt; You're still the one I want for life&lt;br&gt; (You're still the one)&lt;br&gt; You're still the one that I love&lt;br&gt; The only one I dream of&lt;br&gt; You're still the one I kiss good night&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (You're still the one)&lt;br&gt; You're still the one I run to&lt;br&gt; The one that I belong to&lt;br&gt; You're still the one I want for life&lt;br&gt; (You're still the one)&lt;br&gt; You're still the one that I love&lt;br&gt; The only one I dream of&lt;br&gt; You're still the one I kiss good night&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

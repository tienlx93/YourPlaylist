    <Lyrics>[Verse 1]&lt;br&gt; We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain&lt;br&gt; We jumped, never asking why&lt;br&gt; We kissed, I fell under your spell&lt;br&gt; A love no one could deny&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Pre-Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Don’t you ever say I just walked away&lt;br&gt; I will always want you&lt;br&gt; I can’t live a lie, running for my life&lt;br&gt; I will always want you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I came in like a wrecking ball&lt;br&gt; I never hit so hard in love&lt;br&gt; All I wanted was to break your walls&lt;br&gt; All you ever did was wreck me&lt;br&gt; Yeah, you wreck me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2]&lt;br&gt; I put you high up in the sky&lt;br&gt; And now, you’re not coming down&lt;br&gt; It slowly turned, you let me burn&lt;br&gt; And now, we’re ashes on the ground&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Pre-Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Don’t you ever say I just walked away&lt;br&gt; I will always want you&lt;br&gt; I can’t live a lie, running for my life&lt;br&gt; I will always want you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I came in like a wrecking ball&lt;br&gt; I never hit so hard in love&lt;br&gt; All I wanted was to break your walls&lt;br&gt; All you ever did was wreck me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I came in like a wrecking ball&lt;br&gt; Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung&lt;br&gt; Left me crouching in a blaze and fall&lt;br&gt; All you ever did was wreck me&lt;br&gt; Yeah, you wreck me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge]&lt;br&gt; I never meant to start a war&lt;br&gt; I just wanted you to let me in&lt;br&gt; And instead of using force&lt;br&gt; I guess I should’ve let you in&lt;br&gt; I never meant to start a war&lt;br&gt; I just wanted you to let me in&lt;br&gt; I guess I should’ve let you in&lt;br&gt; Don’t you ever say I just walked away&lt;br&gt; I will always want you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I came in like a wrecking ball&lt;br&gt; I never hit so hard in love&lt;br&gt; All I wanted was to break your walls&lt;br&gt; All you ever did was wreck me&lt;br&gt; I came in like a wrecking ball&lt;br&gt; Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung&lt;br&gt; Left me crouching in a blaze and fall&lt;br&gt; All you ever did was wreck me&lt;br&gt; Yeah, you wreck me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Source: http://www.directlyrics.com/miley-cyrus-wrecking-ball-lyrics.html</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>When I'm feeling small when it's cold outside&lt;br&gt; I don't know who I should believe&lt;br&gt; And when I needed someone special just by my side&lt;br&gt; Who was there&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When I'm feeling old when it's rain outside&lt;br&gt; I don't know who is holding me&lt;br&gt; And when I need a little kind and tender moment&lt;br&gt; Who's with me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I believe someday I will love&lt;br&gt; Someone who's by my side&lt;br&gt; Oh someday my special one will come along&lt;br&gt; I'll keep on praying&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When I'm lost inside when I'm down and out&lt;br&gt; I don't know who I should recall&lt;br&gt; And when I needed someone precious&lt;br&gt; Just by my side&lt;br&gt; No one there&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; * I believe someday I will love&lt;br&gt; Someone who's by my side&lt;br&gt; Oh someday my special one will come along&lt;br&gt; I'll pray everyday&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Repeat *]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll pray everyday&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Someday I will love someone who's by my side&lt;br&gt; Oh someday oh someday I keep on praying everday</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I used the deadwood to make the fire rise&lt;br&gt; The blood of innocence burning in the skies&lt;br&gt; I filled my cup with the rising of the sea&lt;br&gt; And poured it out in an ocean of debris&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm swimming in the smoke&lt;br&gt; Of bridges I have burned&lt;br&gt; So don't apologize&lt;br&gt; I'm losing what I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; What I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We held our breath when the clouds began to form&lt;br&gt; But you were lost in the beating of the storm&lt;br&gt; And in the end we were made to be apart&lt;br&gt; In separate chambers of the human heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm swimming in the smoke&lt;br&gt; Of bridges I have burned&lt;br&gt; So don't apologize&lt;br&gt; I'm losing what I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's in the blackened bones&lt;br&gt; Of bridges I have burned&lt;br&gt; So don't apologize&lt;br&gt; I'm losing what I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; What I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm swimming in the smoke&lt;br&gt; Of bridges I have burned&lt;br&gt; So don't apologize&lt;br&gt; I'm losing what I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The blame is mine alone&lt;br&gt; For bridges I have burned&lt;br&gt; So don't apologize&lt;br&gt; I'm losing what I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; What I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; What I don't deserve&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And here's the dead wood to make the fire rise&lt;br&gt; The blood of innocence burning in the skies</Lyrics>

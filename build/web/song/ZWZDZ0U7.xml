    <Lyrics>I want to change the world&lt;br&gt; Keep on holding on your desire&lt;br&gt; You will get that shining love&lt;br&gt; That you can't wait to know&lt;br&gt; If you go on to get your goal&lt;br&gt; It's wonderland&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I felt so worried when I spout out the time&lt;br&gt; Thinking of the future it lies&lt;br&gt; Cause I knew that there's nothing&lt;br&gt; That I really want to know&lt;br&gt; But then I met you so I could feel&lt;br&gt; What you should know&lt;br&gt; I finally find a love&lt;br&gt; And now I'm really feeling her right&lt;br&gt; Cause the matter is gone&lt;br&gt; This is the way to love you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I want to change the world&lt;br&gt; Walk again, never miss the way&lt;br&gt; Don't be afraid, I'm with you&lt;br&gt; And we could fly away&lt;br&gt; If you could stay with me forever&lt;br&gt; Change my mind&lt;br&gt; Won't get lost if your passion's true&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna fly with you again&lt;br&gt; So you can spread your wings&lt;br&gt; And you will fly with me away&lt;br&gt; It's wonderland</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart&lt;br&gt; Without saying a word, you can light up the dark&lt;br&gt; Try as I may, I can never explain&lt;br&gt; What I hear when you don't say a thing&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The smile on your face let's me know that you need me&lt;br&gt; There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me&lt;br&gt; The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall&lt;br&gt; You say it best, when you say nothing at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; All day long I can hear people talking out loud&lt;br&gt; but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd&lt;br&gt; try as they may they can never define&lt;br&gt; What's been said between your heart and mine&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The smile on your face let's me know that you need me&lt;br&gt; There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me&lt;br&gt; The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall&lt;br&gt; You say it best, when you say nothing at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The smile on your face lets me know that you need me&lt;br&gt; There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me&lt;br&gt; The touch of your hand says you'll catch me where ever I fall&lt;br&gt; You say it best when you say nothing at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Nothing at all...</Lyrics>

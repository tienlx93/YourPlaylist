    <Lyrics>How many roads must a man walk down,&lt;br&gt; before you call him a man?&lt;br&gt; How many seas must a white dove fly,&lt;br&gt; before she sleeps in the sand?&lt;br&gt; And how many times must a cannon ball fly,&lt;br&gt; before they're forever banned?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The answer my friend is blowing in the wind,&lt;br&gt; the answer is blowing in the wind.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; How many years can a mountain exist,&lt;br&gt; before it is washed to the sea?&lt;br&gt; How many years can some people exist,&lt;br&gt; before they're allowed to be free?&lt;br&gt; And how many times can a man turn his head,&lt;br&gt; and pretend that he just doesn't see?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The answer my friend is blowing in the wind,&lt;br&gt; the answer is blowing in the wind.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; How many times must a man look up,&lt;br&gt; before he sees the sky?&lt;br&gt; And how many ears must one man have,&lt;br&gt; before he can hear people cry ?&lt;br&gt; And how many deaths will it take till we know,&lt;br&gt; that too many people have died?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The answer my friend is blowing in the wind,&lt;br&gt; the answer is blowing in the wind.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The answer my friend is blowing in the wind,&lt;br&gt; the answer is blowing in the wind.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (Fading out)</Lyrics>

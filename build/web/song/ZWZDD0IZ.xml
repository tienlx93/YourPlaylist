    <Lyrics>The other night dear, as I lay sleeping&lt;br&gt; I dreamed I held you in my arms&lt;br&gt; But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken&lt;br&gt; So I hung my head and I cried.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are my sunshine, my only sunshine&lt;br&gt; You make me happy when skies are gray&lt;br&gt; You'll never know dear, how much I love you&lt;br&gt; Please don't take my sunshine away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll always love you and make you happy,&lt;br&gt; If you will only say the same.&lt;br&gt; But if you leave me and love another,&lt;br&gt; You'll regret it all some day:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are my sunshine, my only sunshine&lt;br&gt; You make me happy when skies are gray&lt;br&gt; You'll never know dear, how much I love you&lt;br&gt; Please don't take my sunshine away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You told me once, dear, you really loved me&lt;br&gt; And no one else could come between.&lt;br&gt; But not you've left me and love another;&lt;br&gt; You have shattered all of my dreams:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are my sunshine, my only sunshine&lt;br&gt; You make me happy when skies are gray&lt;br&gt; You'll never know dear, how much I love you&lt;br&gt; Please don't take my sunshine away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me&lt;br&gt; When I awake my poor heart pains.&lt;br&gt; So when you come back and make me happy&lt;br&gt; I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are my sunshine, my only sunshine&lt;br&gt; You make me happy when skies are gray&lt;br&gt; You'll never know dear, how much I love you&lt;br&gt; Please don't take my sunshine away</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>It starts with one...&lt;br&gt; One thing, &lt;br&gt; I don't know why,&lt;br&gt; It doesn't even matter how hard you try,&lt;br&gt; Keep that in mind,&lt;br&gt; I designed this rhyme,&lt;br&gt; To explain in due time,&lt;br&gt; All I know,&lt;br&gt; Time is a valuable thing,&lt;br&gt; Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings,&lt;br&gt; Watch it count down 'till the end of the day,&lt;br&gt; The clock ticks life away,&lt;br&gt; It's so unreal,&lt;br&gt; You didn't look out below,&lt;br&gt; Watch the time go right out the window,&lt;br&gt; Trying to hold on,&lt;br&gt; Didn't even know, I wasted it all,&lt;br&gt; Just to watch you go,&lt;br&gt; I kept everything inside,&lt;br&gt; And even know I tried,&lt;br&gt; It all fell apart,&lt;br&gt; What it meant to be,&lt;br&gt; Will eventually be,&lt;br&gt; A memory of a time, when ,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I tried so hard and got so far,&lt;br&gt; But in the end, &lt;br&gt; It doesn't even matter,&lt;br&gt; I had to fall, &lt;br&gt; To lose it all,&lt;br&gt; But in the end, &lt;br&gt; It doesn't even matter,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One thing, i don't know why,&lt;br&gt; It doesn't even matter how hard you try,&lt;br&gt; Keep that in mind,&lt;br&gt; I designed this rhyme,&lt;br&gt; To remind myself&lt;br&gt; How I tried so hard...&lt;br&gt; In spite the way you were mocking me,&lt;br&gt; Acting like i was part of your property,&lt;br&gt; Remembering all the times you fought with me,&lt;br&gt; I'm surprised it got so far,&lt;br&gt; Things aren't the way they were before,&lt;br&gt; You wouldn't even recognize me anymore,&lt;br&gt; Not that you knew me back then,&lt;br&gt; But it all comes back to me,&lt;br&gt; In the end...&lt;br&gt; You kept everything inside,&lt;br&gt; And even know i tried it all fell apart,&lt;br&gt; What it meant to me, will,&lt;br&gt; Eventually, be a memory of a time when,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I tried so hard and got so far,&lt;br&gt; But in the end, &lt;br&gt; It doesn't even matter,&lt;br&gt; I had to fall, &lt;br&gt; To lose it all,&lt;br&gt; But in the end, &lt;br&gt; It doesn't even matter,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've put my trust in you,&lt;br&gt; Pushed as far as I can go,&lt;br&gt; For all this,&lt;br&gt; There's only one thing you should know,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've put my trust in you,&lt;br&gt; Pushed as far as i can go,&lt;br&gt; For all this,&lt;br&gt; There's only one thing you should know...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I tried so hard and got so far,&lt;br&gt; But in the end, &lt;br&gt; It doesn't even matter,&lt;br&gt; I had to fall, &lt;br&gt; To lose it all,&lt;br&gt; But in the end, &lt;br&gt; It doesn't even matter</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I've been searching a long time&lt;br&gt; For someone exactly like you&lt;br&gt; I've been travelling all around the world&lt;br&gt; Waiting for you to come through.&lt;br&gt; Someone like you makes it&lt;br&gt; All worth while&lt;br&gt; Someone like you keeps&lt;br&gt; Me satisfied. Someone exactly&lt;br&gt; Like you.&lt;br&gt; I've been travellin' a hard road&lt;br&gt; Lookin' for someone exactly like you&lt;br&gt; I've been carryin' my heavy load&lt;br&gt; Waiting for the light to come&lt;br&gt; Shining through.&lt;br&gt; Someone like you makes it&lt;br&gt; All worth while&lt;br&gt; Someone like you keeps&lt;br&gt; Me satisfied. Someone exactly&lt;br&gt; Like you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've been doin' some soul searching&lt;br&gt; To find out where you're at&lt;br&gt; I've been up and down the highway&lt;br&gt; In all kinds of foreign lands&lt;br&gt; Someone like you... [etc.]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've been all around the world&lt;br&gt; Marching to the beat of a different&lt;br&gt; Drum.&lt;br&gt; But just lately I have&lt;br&gt; Realised&lt;br&gt; The best is yet to come.&lt;br&gt; Someone like you... [etc.]</Lyrics>

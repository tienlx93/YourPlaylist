    <Lyrics>&lt;br&gt; &quot;Need You Now&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor.&lt;br&gt; Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore.&lt;br&gt; And I wonder if I ever cross your mind?&lt;br&gt; For me it happens all the time.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.&lt;br&gt; Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now.&lt;br&gt; And I don't know how I can do without.&lt;br&gt; I just need you now.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door.&lt;br&gt; Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.&lt;br&gt; And I wonder if I ever cross your mind?&lt;br&gt; For me it happens all the time.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh whoa&lt;br&gt; Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.&lt;br&gt; And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.&lt;br&gt; Well I don't know how I can do without.&lt;br&gt; I just need you now&lt;br&gt; I just need you now.&lt;br&gt; Oh baby I need you now.</Lyrics>

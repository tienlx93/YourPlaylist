    <Lyrics>I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room&lt;br&gt; Seems like everyone around me's on their honeymoon&lt;br&gt; I'd love to take a pin to a heart-shaped balloon&lt;br&gt; Everybody's got somebody but me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well I don't know how I landed on this movie set&lt;br&gt; It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'&lt;br&gt; I never would have noticed if we'd never met&lt;br&gt; But everybody's got somebody but me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I miss you&lt;br&gt; Without you I just don't fit in&lt;br&gt; I know we're through&lt;br&gt; But I'm wishing we could try it again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I hear loves songs playing on the radio&lt;br&gt; People slow dancing everywhere I go&lt;br&gt; Well I'm a good slow dancer but you'd never know&lt;br&gt; Cause everybody's got somebody but me&lt;br&gt; Yeah they do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Everybody's got somebody....&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I miss you&lt;br&gt; Without you I just don't fit in&lt;br&gt; I know we're through&lt;br&gt; But I'm wishing we could try it again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sitting here lonely at a table for two&lt;br&gt; Watching lovers being lovers in the corner booth&lt;br&gt; Seems like even cupid don't know what to do&lt;br&gt; Everybody's got somebody but me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever find another you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But everybody's got somebody but me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Everybody, got somebody&lt;br&gt; Oh everybody, everybody, everybody but me now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (Everybody's got somebody)&lt;br&gt; Everybody has got somebody&lt;br&gt; (Everybody but me)&lt;br&gt; Everybody but me&lt;br&gt; (Everybody's got somebody)&lt;br&gt; Everybody&lt;br&gt; I miss you&lt;br&gt; (Everybody but me)&lt;br&gt; Everybody's got somebody but me</Lyrics>

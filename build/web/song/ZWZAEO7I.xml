    <Lyrics>&lt;br&gt; I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house&lt;br&gt; That don’t bother me&lt;br&gt; I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out&lt;br&gt; I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while&lt;br&gt; Even though going on with you gone still upsets me&lt;br&gt; There are days every now and again I pretend I’m ok&lt;br&gt; But that’s not what gets me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What hurts the most&lt;br&gt; Was being so close&lt;br&gt; And having so much to say&lt;br&gt; And watching you walk away&lt;br&gt; And never knowing&lt;br&gt; What could have been&lt;br&gt; And not seeing that loving you&lt;br&gt; Is what I was tryin’ to do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go&lt;br&gt; But I’m doin’ It&lt;br&gt; It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone&lt;br&gt; Still Harder&lt;br&gt; Getting up, getting dressed, livin’ with this regret&lt;br&gt; But I know if I could do it over&lt;br&gt; I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart&lt;br&gt; That I left unspoken&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What hurts the most&lt;br&gt; Is being so close&lt;br&gt; And having so much to say&lt;br&gt; And watching you walk away&lt;br&gt; And never knowing&lt;br&gt; What could have been&lt;br&gt; And not seeing that loving you&lt;br&gt; Is what I was trying to do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What hurts the most&lt;br&gt; Is being so close&lt;br&gt; And having so much to say&lt;br&gt; And watching you walk away&lt;br&gt; And never knowing&lt;br&gt; What could have been&lt;br&gt; And not seeing that loving you&lt;br&gt; Is what I was trying to do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Not seeing that loving you&lt;br&gt; That’s what I was trying to do</Lyrics>

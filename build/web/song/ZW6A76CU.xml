    <Lyrics>I got my shades on, top back,&lt;br&gt; Rolling with the music jacked,&lt;br&gt; One on the wheel, one around you baby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Little sun left to burn in the blue sky,&lt;br&gt; Shinning of the cross hanging from the mirror of my ride,&lt;br&gt; Breeze blowing in, your hair blowing round&lt;br&gt; You're scanning through the stations looking for that country sound&lt;br&gt; The good stuff iced up in the back seat,&lt;br&gt; Nowhere to go, nowhere to be&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I got my shades on, top back,&lt;br&gt; Rolling with the music jacked,&lt;br&gt; One on the wheel, one around you baby&lt;br&gt; Sunset&lt;br&gt; I bet&lt;br&gt; There's a chance we can get&lt;br&gt; Sure enough&lt;br&gt; Tangled up,&lt;br&gt; Laid back and lazy&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Pour it on easy now, don't spill a bit&lt;br&gt; Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killing it&lt;br&gt; Long as I'm rocking with you, girl&lt;br&gt; You know I'm cool with just chillin' it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Nothing but two lane country on up ahead&lt;br&gt; Girl, you so fine I wouldn't mind if this is all we did.&lt;br&gt; You got me high on kisses, you got me missing signs&lt;br&gt; Hard looking left when my world is on my right&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I got my shades on, top back,&lt;br&gt; Rolling with the music jacked,&lt;br&gt; One on the wheel, one around you baby&lt;br&gt; Sunset&lt;br&gt; I bet&lt;br&gt; There's a chance we can get&lt;br&gt; Sure enough&lt;br&gt; Tangled up,&lt;br&gt; Laid back and lazy&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Pour it on easy now, don't spill a bit&lt;br&gt; Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killing it&lt;br&gt; Long as I'm rocking with you, girl&lt;br&gt; You know I'm cool with just chillin' it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Nothing like a little you and me low key&lt;br&gt; Right now I'm right where i wanna be&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I got my shades on, top back,&lt;br&gt; Rolling with the music jacked,&lt;br&gt; One on the wheel, one around you baby&lt;br&gt; Sunset&lt;br&gt; I bet&lt;br&gt; There's a chance we can get&lt;br&gt; Sure enough&lt;br&gt; Tangled up,&lt;br&gt; Laid back and lazy&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Pour it on easy now, don't spill a bit&lt;br&gt; Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killing it&lt;br&gt; Long as I'm rocking with you, girl&lt;br&gt; You know I'm cool with just chillin' it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Girl, I love rocking with you when, girl, we're just chilling it</Lyrics>

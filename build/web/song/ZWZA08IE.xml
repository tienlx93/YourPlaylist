    <Lyrics>&quot;Space Bound&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 1:]&lt;br&gt; We touch I feel a rush&lt;br&gt; We clutch it isn't much&lt;br&gt; But its enough to make me wonder whats in store for us&lt;br&gt; Its lust its torturousâ€‚&lt;br&gt; You must be a sorceress cause you just&lt;br&gt; Did the impossible&lt;br&gt; Gain my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous&lt;br&gt; If you fuck me over&lt;br&gt; Cause if I get burnt imma show you what its like to hurt&lt;br&gt; Cause I been treated like dirt before ya&lt;br&gt; And love is evil&lt;br&gt; Spell it backwards I'll show ya&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Nobody knows me I'm cold&lt;br&gt; Walk down this road all alone&lt;br&gt; Its no one's fault but my own&lt;br&gt; Its the path I've chosen to go&lt;br&gt; Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so&lt;br&gt; Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking hoes&lt;br&gt; Bloodsucking succubus what the fuck is up with this&lt;br&gt; I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this&lt;br&gt; Its sucks but its exactly what I thought it would be&lt;br&gt; Like trying to start over&lt;br&gt; I got a hole in my heart, I'm some kind of emotional rollercoaster&lt;br&gt; Somethin I wont go on til you toy with my emotion so its over&lt;br&gt; Its like an explosion everytime I hold ya wasn't joking when I told ya&lt;br&gt; Ya take my breathe away&lt;br&gt; You're a supernova.. and I'm a&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon&lt;br&gt; And I'm aiming right at you&lt;br&gt; Right at you&lt;br&gt; 250 thousand miles on a clear night in June&lt;br&gt; And I'm aiming right at you&lt;br&gt; Right at you&lt;br&gt; Right at you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2:]&lt;br&gt; I do whatever it takes&lt;br&gt; When I'm with you I get the shakes&lt;br&gt; My body aches when I ain't&lt;br&gt; With you I have zero strength&lt;br&gt; There's no limit on how far I would go&lt;br&gt; No boundaries no lengths&lt;br&gt; Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks&lt;br&gt; Gonna be that one and then once we get em its never the same&lt;br&gt; You want them when they don't want you&lt;br&gt; Soon as they do feelings change&lt;br&gt; Its not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate&lt;br&gt; I wasn't lookin but I stumbled onto you must've been fate&lt;br&gt; But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take&lt;br&gt; Lets cut to the chase&lt;br&gt; But a door shuts in your face&lt;br&gt; Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open&lt;br&gt; That I wont be making a mistake&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 3:]&lt;br&gt; So after a year and 6 months its no longer me that you want&lt;br&gt; But I love you so much it hurts&lt;br&gt; Never mistreated you once&lt;br&gt; I poured my heart out to you&lt;br&gt; Let down my guard swear to god&lt;br&gt; Ill blow my brains in your lap&lt;br&gt; Lay here and die in your arms&lt;br&gt; Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin&lt;br&gt; I'm trying to stop you from leaving&lt;br&gt; You won't even listen so fuck it&lt;br&gt; I'm trying to stop you from breathing&lt;br&gt; I put both hands on your throat&lt;br&gt; I sit on top of you squeezing&lt;br&gt; Til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick&lt;br&gt; Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house&lt;br&gt; And let you live&lt;br&gt; Tears stream down both of my cheeks&lt;br&gt; Then I let you just go and just give&lt;br&gt; And before I put that gun to my temple&lt;br&gt; I told you this&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I would've done anything for you&lt;br&gt; To show you how much I adored you&lt;br&gt; But its over now&lt;br&gt; Its too late to save our love&lt;br&gt; Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star cause imma&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon&lt;br&gt; And I'm aiming right at you&lt;br&gt; Right at you&lt;br&gt; 250 thousand miles on a clear night in June&lt;br&gt; And I'm so lost without you&lt;br&gt; Without you&lt;br&gt; Without you &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

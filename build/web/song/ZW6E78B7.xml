    <Lyrics>&quot;Maps&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I miss the taste of a sweeter life&lt;br&gt; I miss the conversation&lt;br&gt; I’m searching for a song tonight&lt;br&gt; I’m changing all of the stations&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I like to think that we had it all&lt;br&gt; We drew a map to a better place&lt;br&gt; But on that road I took a fall&lt;br&gt; Oh baby why did you run away?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I was there for you&lt;br&gt; In your darkest times&lt;br&gt; I was there for you&lt;br&gt; In your darkest nights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I wonder where were you?&lt;br&gt; When I was at my worst&lt;br&gt; Down on my knees&lt;br&gt; And you said you had my back&lt;br&gt; So I wonder where were you?&lt;br&gt; When all the roads you took came back to me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I’m following the map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Ain't nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Ain't nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I hear your voice in my sleep at night&lt;br&gt; Hard to resist temptation&lt;br&gt; 'Cause something strange has come over me&lt;br&gt; And now I can’t get over you&lt;br&gt; No, I just can’t get over you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I was there for you&lt;br&gt; In your darkest times&lt;br&gt; I was there for you&lt;br&gt; In your darkest nights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I wonder where were you?&lt;br&gt; When I was at my worst&lt;br&gt; Down on my knees&lt;br&gt; And you said you had my back&lt;br&gt; So I wonder where were you?&lt;br&gt; When all the roads you took came back to me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I’m following the map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Ain't nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Ain't nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh&lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh&lt;br&gt; Yeah yeah yeah&lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, I was there for you&lt;br&gt; Oh, in your darkest time&lt;br&gt; Oh, I was there for you&lt;br&gt; Oh, in your darkest nights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, I was there for you&lt;br&gt; Oh, in your darkest time&lt;br&gt; Oh, I was there for you&lt;br&gt; Oh, in your darkest nights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I wonder where were you?&lt;br&gt; When I was at my worst&lt;br&gt; Down on my knees&lt;br&gt; And you said you had my back&lt;br&gt; So I wonder where were you?&lt;br&gt; When all the roads you took came back to me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I’m following the map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Ain't nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Ain't nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following</Lyrics>

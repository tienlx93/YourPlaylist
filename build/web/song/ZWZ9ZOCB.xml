    <Lyrics>This is not the end&lt;br&gt; This is not the beginning&lt;br&gt; Just a voice like a riot&lt;br&gt; Rocking every revision&lt;br&gt; But you listen to the tone&lt;br&gt; And the violent rhythm&lt;br&gt; Though the words sound steady&lt;br&gt; Something emptys within em&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We say yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With fists flying up in the air&lt;br&gt; Like we’re holding onto something that’s invisible there&lt;br&gt; Cuz we’re living at the mercy of the pain and the fear&lt;br&gt; Until we dead it forget it&lt;br&gt; Let it all disappear&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Waiting for the end to come&lt;br&gt; Wishing I had strenght to stand&lt;br&gt; This is not what I had planned&lt;br&gt; It’s out of my control&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Flying at the speed of light&lt;br&gt; Thoughts were spinning in my head&lt;br&gt; So many things were left unsaid&lt;br&gt; It’s hard to let you go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I know what it takes to move on&lt;br&gt; I know how it feels to lie&lt;br&gt; All I wanna do is trade this life for something new&lt;br&gt; Holding on to what I haven’t got&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sitting in an empty room&lt;br&gt; Trying to forget the past&lt;br&gt; This was never meant to last&lt;br&gt; I wish it wasn’t so&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What was left when that fire was gone&lt;br&gt; I thought it felt right but that right was wrong&lt;br&gt; All caught up in the eye of the storm&lt;br&gt; And trying to figure out what it’s like moving on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I don’t even know what kind of things I said&lt;br&gt; My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead&lt;br&gt; Picking up those pieces now where to begin&lt;br&gt; The hardest part of ending is starting again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; All I wanna do is trade this life for something new&lt;br&gt; Holding on to what I haven’t got&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This is not the end&lt;br&gt; This is not the beginning&lt;br&gt; Just a voice like a riot&lt;br&gt; Rocking every revision&lt;br&gt; But you listen to the tone&lt;br&gt; And the violent rhythm&lt;br&gt; Though the words sound steady&lt;br&gt; Something emptys within em&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We say yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With fists flying up in the air&lt;br&gt; Like we’re holding onto something that’s invisible there&lt;br&gt; Cuz we’re living at the mercy of the pain and the fear&lt;br&gt; Until we dead it forget it&lt;br&gt; Let it all disappear</Lyrics>

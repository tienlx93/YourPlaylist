    <Lyrics>No more champagne&lt;br&gt; And the fireworks are through&lt;br&gt; Here we are, me and you&lt;br&gt; Feeling lost and feeling blue&lt;br&gt; It's the end of the party&lt;br&gt; And the morning seems so grey&lt;br&gt; So unlike yesterday&lt;br&gt; Now's the time for us to say...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; May we all have a vision now and then&lt;br&gt; Of a world where every neighbour is a friend&lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; May we all have our hopes, our will to try&lt;br&gt; If we don't we might as well lay down and die&lt;br&gt; You and I&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sometimes I see&lt;br&gt; How the brave new world arrives&lt;br&gt; And I see how it thrives&lt;br&gt; In the ashes of our lives&lt;br&gt; Oh yes, man is a fool&lt;br&gt; And he thinks he'll be okay&lt;br&gt; Dragging on, feet of clay&lt;br&gt; Never knowing he's astray&lt;br&gt; Keeps on going anyway...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; May we all have a vision now and then&lt;br&gt; Of a world where every neighbour is a friend&lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; May we all have our hopes, our will to try&lt;br&gt; If we don't we might as well lay down and die&lt;br&gt; You and I&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Seems to me now&lt;br&gt; That the dreams we had before&lt;br&gt; Are all dead, nothing more&lt;br&gt; Than confetti on the floor&lt;br&gt; It's the end of a decade&lt;br&gt; In another ten years time&lt;br&gt; Who can say what we'll find&lt;br&gt; What lies waiting down the line&lt;br&gt; In the end of eighty-nine...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; May we all have a vision now and then&lt;br&gt; Of a world where every neighbour is a friend&lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; Happy new year&lt;br&gt; May we all have our hopes, our will to try&lt;br&gt; If we don't we might as well lay down and die&lt;br&gt; You and I&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

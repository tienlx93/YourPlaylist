    <Lyrics>Just look at you, girl&lt;br&gt; Standin' here beside me&lt;br&gt; Starlight on your hair&lt;br&gt; Lookin' like a dream&lt;br&gt; I dreamed somewhere&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And look at me, girl&lt;br&gt; You got me actin' just like a lover&lt;br&gt; In an old time picture show&lt;br&gt; And how I got the part&lt;br&gt; I just don't know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But it's written&lt;br&gt; All across your face&lt;br&gt; Plain as it can be&lt;br&gt; You're the one&lt;br&gt; That I was lookin' for&lt;br&gt; Now you're all&lt;br&gt; That I can see&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And you mean everythin' to me&lt;br&gt; And I'd do anythin'&lt;br&gt; To have you stay forever&lt;br&gt; I'm an ordinary man&lt;br&gt; But I feel like I could do&lt;br&gt; Anythin' in the world&lt;br&gt; When I look at you, girl&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just look at you, girl&lt;br&gt; Walkin' here beside me&lt;br&gt; In misty mornin' light&lt;br&gt; I see my own reflection&lt;br&gt; In your eyes&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And you smile at me, girl&lt;br&gt; With eyes that tell a story&lt;br&gt; That words can never say&lt;br&gt; Tellin' me your love&lt;br&gt; Is gonna stay&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And we're standin'&lt;br&gt; Right together now&lt;br&gt; In everythin' we do&lt;br&gt; And if my world&lt;br&gt; Should come apart&lt;br&gt; I'll still be lovin' you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 'Cause you mean everythin' to me&lt;br&gt; And I'd do anythin'&lt;br&gt; To have you stay forever&lt;br&gt; I'm an ordinary man&lt;br&gt; But I feel like I could do&lt;br&gt; Anythin' in the world&lt;br&gt; When I look at you, girl</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Hey, once upon a younger year&lt;br&gt; When all our shadows disappeared&lt;br&gt; The animals inside came out to play&lt;br&gt; Hey, went face to face with all our fears&lt;br&gt; Learned our lessons through the tears&lt;br&gt; Made memories we knew would never fade&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One day my father—he told me,&lt;br&gt; &quot;Son, don't let it slip away.&quot;&lt;br&gt; He took me in his arms, I heard him say,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &quot;When you get older&lt;br&gt; Your wild heart will live for younger days&lt;br&gt; Think of me if ever you're afraid.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He said, &quot;One day you'll leave this world behind&lt;br&gt; So live a life you will remember.&quot;&lt;br&gt; My father told me when I was just a child&lt;br&gt; These are the nights that never die&lt;br&gt; My father told me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Instrumental]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When thunder clouds start pouring down&lt;br&gt; Light a fire they can't put out&lt;br&gt; Carve your name into those shining stars&lt;br&gt; He said, &quot;Go venture far beyond these shores.&lt;br&gt; Don't forsake this life of yours.&lt;br&gt; I'll guide you home no matter where you are.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One day my father—he told me,&lt;br&gt; &quot;Son, don't let it slip away.&quot;&lt;br&gt; When I was just a kid I heard him say,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &quot;When you get older&lt;br&gt; Your wild heart will live for younger days&lt;br&gt; Think of me if ever you're afraid.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He said, &quot;One day you'll leave this world behind&lt;br&gt; So live a life you will remember.&quot;&lt;br&gt; My father told me when I was just a child&lt;br&gt; These are the nights that never die&lt;br&gt; My father told me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; These are the nights that never die&lt;br&gt; My father told me&lt;br&gt; Hey, hey</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Hiding from the rain and snow&lt;br&gt; Trying to forget but I won't let go&lt;br&gt; Looking at a crowded street&lt;br&gt; Listening to my own heart beat&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So many people all around the world&lt;br&gt; Tell me where do I find someone like you girl&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Take me to your heart take me to your soul&lt;br&gt; Give me your hand before I'm old&lt;br&gt; Show me what love is - haven't got a clue&lt;br&gt; Show me that wonders can be true&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; They say nothing lasts forever&lt;br&gt; We're only here today&lt;br&gt; Love is now or never&lt;br&gt; Bring me far away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Take me to your heart take me to your soul&lt;br&gt; Give me your hand and hold me&lt;br&gt; Show me what love is - be my guiding star&lt;br&gt; It's easy take me to your heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Standing on a mountain high&lt;br&gt; Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky&lt;br&gt; I should go and see some friends&lt;br&gt; But they don't really comprehend&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Don't need too much talking without saying anything&lt;br&gt; All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing&lt;br&gt; [Chorus]</Lyrics>

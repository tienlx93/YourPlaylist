    <Lyrics>I know your eyes in the morning sun&lt;br&gt; I feel you touch me in the pouring rain&lt;br&gt; And the moment that you wander far from me&lt;br&gt; I wanna feel you in my arms again&lt;br&gt; And you come to me on a summer breeze&lt;br&gt; Keep me warm with your love then you softly leave&lt;br&gt; And it's me you need to show&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; How deep is your love&lt;br&gt; ( How deep is your love)&lt;br&gt; I really mean to learn&lt;br&gt; 'Cause we're living in a world of fools,&lt;br&gt; breaking us down&lt;br&gt; When they all should let us be,&lt;br&gt; We belong to you and me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I belive in you,&lt;br&gt; You know the door to my very soul&lt;br&gt; You're the light in my deepest darkest hour&lt;br&gt; You're my savior when I fall (when I fall)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And you may not think I care for you&lt;br&gt; When you know down inside that I really do&lt;br&gt; And it's me you need to show&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; How deep is your love&lt;br&gt; ( How deep is your love)&lt;br&gt; I really mean to learn&lt;br&gt; 'Cause we're living in a world of fools,&lt;br&gt; Breaking us down&lt;br&gt; When they all should let us be,&lt;br&gt; We belong to you and me</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Lit up the world as I fell asleep&lt;br&gt; Cause they'd fill the open air&lt;br&gt; And leave tear drops everywhere&lt;br&gt; You'd think me rude but I would just stand and&lt;br&gt; Stare&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'd like to make myself believe&lt;br&gt; That planet Earth turns, slowly&lt;br&gt; It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep&lt;br&gt; Cause everything is never as it seems&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause I'd get a thousand hugs&lt;br&gt; From ten thousand lightning bugs&lt;br&gt; As they tried to teach my how to dance&lt;br&gt; A foxtrot above my head&lt;br&gt; A sock-hop beneath my bed&lt;br&gt; The disco ball is just hanging by a thread&lt;br&gt; (Thread, thread...)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'd like to make myself believe&lt;br&gt; That planet Earth turns, slowly&lt;br&gt; It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep&lt;br&gt; Cause everything is never as it seems&lt;br&gt; (When I fall asleep)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Leave my door open just a crack&lt;br&gt; (Please take me away from here)&lt;br&gt; Cause I feel like such an insomniac&lt;br&gt; (Please take me away from here)&lt;br&gt; Why do I tire of counting sheep?&lt;br&gt; (Please take me away from here)&lt;br&gt; When I'm far too tired to fall asleep&lt;br&gt; (Ha-ha)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To ten million fireflies&lt;br&gt; I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes&lt;br&gt; I got misty eyes as they said farewell&lt;br&gt; (Said farewell)&lt;br&gt; But I'll know where several are&lt;br&gt; If my dreams get real bizarre&lt;br&gt; Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar&lt;br&gt; (Jar, jar, jar...)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'd like to make myself believe&lt;br&gt; That planet Earth turns, slowly&lt;br&gt; It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep&lt;br&gt; Cause everything is never as it seems&lt;br&gt; (When I fall asleep)&lt;br&gt; [x2]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'd like to make myself believe&lt;br&gt; That planet Earth turns, slowly&lt;br&gt; It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep&lt;br&gt; Because my dreams are bursting at the seams</Lyrics>

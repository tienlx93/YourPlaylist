    <Lyrics>Picture perfect memories&lt;br&gt; Scattered all around the floor&lt;br&gt; Reaching for the phone&lt;br&gt; Cuz I can't fight it anymore&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I wonder if I ever cross your mind&lt;br&gt; For me it happens all the time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's a quarter after one&lt;br&gt; I'm alone and I need you now&lt;br&gt; Said I wouldn't call&lt;br&gt; But I lost all control&lt;br&gt; And I need you now&lt;br&gt; And I don't know how I can do without&lt;br&gt; I just need you now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Another shot of whiskey&lt;br&gt; Can't stop looking at the door&lt;br&gt; Wishing you'd come sweeping in&lt;br&gt; The way you did before&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I wonder if I ever cross your mind&lt;br&gt; For me it happens all the time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's a quarter after one&lt;br&gt; I'm a little drunk and I need you now&lt;br&gt; Said I wouldn't call&lt;br&gt; But I lost all control&lt;br&gt; And I need you now&lt;br&gt; And I don't know how I can do without&lt;br&gt; I just need you now wo oh oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's a quarter after one&lt;br&gt; I'm alone and I need you now&lt;br&gt; And I said I wouldn't call&lt;br&gt; But I'm a little drunk&lt;br&gt; And I need you now&lt;br&gt; And I don't know how I can do without&lt;br&gt; I just need you now&lt;br&gt; I just need you now&lt;br&gt; Oh baby I need you now</Lyrics>

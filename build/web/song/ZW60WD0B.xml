    <Lyrics>Every dream that I dream &lt;br&gt; Seems to float on by &lt;br&gt; Like a cloud in the wind &lt;br&gt; Way up in the sky &lt;br&gt; Every move that I make &lt;br&gt; Seems to be the wrong way &lt;br&gt; Like a cold black night &lt;br&gt; After a summer day &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; Nothing to say but it used to be &lt;br&gt; Nothing to say but it used to be &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You still play my guitar &lt;br&gt; With a smile on my face &lt;br&gt; Now everything's changed &lt;br&gt; My whole life's rearranged &lt;br&gt; From the day I was born &lt;br&gt; Sidle Jinks was my name &lt;br&gt; Though I tried and I tried &lt;br&gt; That name still remains &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; Nothing to say but it used to be &lt;br&gt; Nothing to say but it used to be &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; What can I do &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I hear voices all singing &lt;br&gt; But no one is there &lt;br&gt; It's a ghost of my life &lt;br&gt; Bringing past tense to mind &lt;br&gt; Lokin' key inside me &lt;br&gt; From the freedom and sin &lt;br&gt; Oh come let me in &lt;br&gt; I'll start all over again</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>A ray of hope flickers in the sky&lt;br&gt; A tiny star lights up way up high&lt;br&gt; All across the land dawns a brand new morn'&lt;br&gt; This comes to pass when a child is born.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A silent wish sails the seven seas&lt;br&gt; The winds of change whisper in the trees&lt;br&gt; And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn&lt;br&gt; This comes to pass when a child is born.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A rosy hue settles all around&lt;br&gt; You got the feel, you're on solid ground&lt;br&gt; For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn&lt;br&gt; This comes to pass when a child is born.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And all of this happens because the world is waiting&lt;br&gt; Waiting for one child, black, white, yellow - no one knows&lt;br&gt; But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter&lt;br&gt; Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbour&lt;br&gt; And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's all a dream, an illusion now&lt;br&gt; It must come true sometime soon somehow&lt;br&gt; All across the land dawns a brand new morn'&lt;br&gt; This comes to pass when a child is born.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This comes to pass when a child is born.&lt;br&gt; Is born.&lt;br&gt; Is born...</Lyrics>

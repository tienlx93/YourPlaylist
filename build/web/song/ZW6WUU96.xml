    <Lyrics>Right from the start&lt;br&gt; You were a thief you stole my heart&lt;br&gt; And I your willing victim&lt;br&gt; I let you see the parts of me&lt;br&gt; That weren't all that pretty&lt;br&gt; And with every touch you fixed them&lt;br&gt; Now you've been talking in your sleep&lt;br&gt; Oh oh&lt;br&gt; Things you never say to me&lt;br&gt; Oh oh&lt;br&gt; Tell me that you've had enough&lt;br&gt; Of our love, our love&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just give me a reason&lt;br&gt; Just a little bit's enough&lt;br&gt; Just a second we're not broken just bent&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; It's in the stars&lt;br&gt; It's been written in the scars on our hearts&lt;br&gt; We're not broken just bent&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from&lt;br&gt; I thought that we were fine&lt;br&gt; Oh we had everything&lt;br&gt; Your head is running wild again&lt;br&gt; My dear we still have everything&lt;br&gt; And it's all in your mind&lt;br&gt; Yeah but this is happening&lt;br&gt; You've been having real bad dreams&lt;br&gt; Oh oh&lt;br&gt; You used to lie so close to me&lt;br&gt; Oh oh&lt;br&gt; There's nothing more than empty sheets&lt;br&gt; Between our love, our love, oh our love, our love&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just give me a reason&lt;br&gt; Just a little bit's enough&lt;br&gt; Just a second we're not broken just bent&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; It's in the stars&lt;br&gt; It's been written in the scars on our hearts&lt;br&gt; We're not broken just bent&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh tears ducts and rust&lt;br&gt; I'll fix it for us&lt;br&gt; We're collecting dust but our love's enough&lt;br&gt; You're holding it in&lt;br&gt; You're pouring a drink&lt;br&gt; No nothing is as bad as it seems&lt;br&gt; We'll come clean&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just give me a reason&lt;br&gt; Just a little bit's enough&lt;br&gt; Just a second we're not broken just bent&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; It's in the stars&lt;br&gt; It's been written in the scars on our hearts&lt;br&gt; We're not broken just bent&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just give me a reason&lt;br&gt; Just a little bit's enough&lt;br&gt; Just a second we're not broken just bent&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; It's in the stars&lt;br&gt; It's been written in the scars on our hearts&lt;br&gt; We're not broken just bent&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We're not broken just bent&lt;br&gt; And we can learn to love again</Lyrics>

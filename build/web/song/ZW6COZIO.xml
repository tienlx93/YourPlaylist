    <Lyrics>Tearing me apart with what you wanna say&lt;br&gt; Suddenly tomorrow's moment washed away&lt;br&gt; Cuz I don't have a reason and you don't have the time&lt;br&gt; But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The light on the horizon is brighter yesterday&lt;br&gt; Shadows floating over, skies begin to fade&lt;br&gt; You said it was forever but then it slipped away&lt;br&gt; Standing at the end of the final masquerade&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; All I've ever wanted, the secrets that you keep&lt;br&gt; All you've ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak&lt;br&gt; Cuz I can't see forgiveness, and you can't see the crime&lt;br&gt; If we both keep on waiting for what we left behind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The light on the horizon is brighter yesterday&lt;br&gt; Shadow floating over, sky's begin to fade&lt;br&gt; You said it was forever but then it slipped away&lt;br&gt; Standing at the end of the final masquerade&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; the final masquerade&lt;br&gt; the final masquerade&lt;br&gt; Standing at the end of the final masquerade&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The light on the horizon is brighter yesterday&lt;br&gt; Shadow floating over, sky's begin to fade&lt;br&gt; You said it was forever but then it slipped away&lt;br&gt; Standing at the end of the final masquerade</Lyrics>

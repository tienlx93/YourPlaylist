    <Lyrics>&quot;Ring My Bells&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sometimes you love it&lt;br&gt; Sometimes you don't&lt;br&gt; Sometimes you need it and you don't wanna let go..&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sometimes we rush it&lt;br&gt; Sometimes we fall&lt;br&gt; It doesn't matter baby we can take it real slow..&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause the way that we touch is something that we can't deny&lt;br&gt; And the way that you move oh it makes me feel alive&lt;br&gt; Come on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; You try to hide it&lt;br&gt; I know you do&lt;br&gt; When all you really want is me to come and get to&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You move in closer&lt;br&gt; I feel you breathe&lt;br&gt; It's like the world just disappears when you around me oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause the way that we touch is something that we can't deny oh yeah&lt;br&gt; And the way that you move oh you make me feel alive so&lt;br&gt; Come on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I say you want, I say you need&lt;br&gt; I can tell by your face, you know the way it turns me on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I say you want, I say you need&lt;br&gt; I will do what it takes, I would never do you wrong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause the way that we love is something that we can't fight oh yeah&lt;br&gt; I just can't get enough oh you make me feel alive so come on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; I say you want, I say you need&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells..&lt;br&gt; I say you want, I say you need&lt;br&gt; Ring my bell, ring my bells. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

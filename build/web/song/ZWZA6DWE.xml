    <Lyrics>&lt;br&gt; I wake up in the morning so far away from home, &lt;br&gt; trying to make it through the day. &lt;br&gt; Many miles are between us, I'm sending my love from this payphone. &lt;br&gt; Through the storms we've wandered, many mountains we have climbed &lt;br&gt; but all the bad times are behind.&lt;br&gt; The road is free - &lt;br&gt; I'm coming Home.&lt;br&gt; Without you I am like a ship without it's sails, calling the wind to save me. &lt;br&gt; I'd climb the highest mountain, &lt;br&gt; I'd cross the seven seas just to see your smile again. &lt;br&gt; All the trust that was built along the years is coming back to stay I know.&lt;br&gt; Just look ahead the road is free - &lt;br&gt; I'm coming Home.&lt;br&gt; With every step I'm closer to home, when I'm back you won't be alone. &lt;br&gt; Soon I'll see the familiar door before my eyes and you.</Lyrics>

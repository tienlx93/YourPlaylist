    <Lyrics>Weather man said it’s gonna snow&lt;br&gt; By now I should be used to the cold&lt;br&gt; Mid-February shouldn’t be so scary&lt;br&gt; It was only December&lt;br&gt; I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But you went away&lt;br&gt; How dare you?&lt;br&gt; I miss you&lt;br&gt; They say I’ll be OK&lt;br&gt; But I’m not going to ever get over you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Living alone here in this place&lt;br&gt; I think of you, and I’m not afraid&lt;br&gt; Your favorite records make me feel better&lt;br&gt; Cause you sing along&lt;br&gt; With every song&lt;br&gt; I know you didn’t mean to give them to me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But you went away&lt;br&gt; How dare you?&lt;br&gt; I miss you&lt;br&gt; They say I’ll be OK&lt;br&gt; But I’m not going to ever get over you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause you went away,&lt;br&gt; How dare you?&lt;br&gt; I miss you&lt;br&gt; They say I’ll be OK&lt;br&gt; But I’m not going to ever get over you</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&quot;Stay With Me&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 1:]&lt;br&gt; Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand&lt;br&gt; But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man&lt;br&gt; These nights never seem to go to plan&lt;br&gt; I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; Oh, won't you stay with me?&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you're all I need&lt;br&gt; This ain't love, it's clear to see&lt;br&gt; But darling, stay with me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2:]&lt;br&gt; Why am I so emotional?&lt;br&gt; No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control&lt;br&gt; And deep down I know this never works&lt;br&gt; But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus 3x]</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&quot;California King Bed&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Chest to chest &lt;br&gt; Nose to nose &lt;br&gt; Palm to palm &lt;br&gt; We were always just that close &lt;br&gt; Wrist to wrist &lt;br&gt; Toe to toe &lt;br&gt; Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose &lt;br&gt; So how come when I reach out my finger &lt;br&gt; It feels like more than distance between us &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In this California king bed &lt;br&gt; Were 10000 miles apart &lt;br&gt; I'll be California wishing on the stars &lt;br&gt; For you're heart on me &lt;br&gt; My California king &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Eye to eye &lt;br&gt; Cheek to cheek &lt;br&gt; Side by side &lt;br&gt; You were sleeping next to me &lt;br&gt; Arm in arm &lt;br&gt; Dusk to dawn &lt;br&gt; With the curtains drawn &lt;br&gt; And a little last night on these sheets &lt;br&gt; So how come when I reach out my finger &lt;br&gt; It feels like more than distance between us &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In this California king bed &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Were 10000 miles apart &lt;br&gt; I'll be California wishing on the stars &lt;br&gt; For you're heart on me &lt;br&gt; My California king &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just when I felt like giving up on us &lt;br&gt; You turned around and gave me one last touch &lt;br&gt; That made everything feel better &lt;br&gt; And even then my eyes got wetter &lt;br&gt; So confused wanna ask you if you love me&lt;br&gt; But I don't wanna feel so weak &lt;br&gt; Maybe I've been California dreaming &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In this California king bed &lt;br&gt; Were 10000 miles apart &lt;br&gt; I'll be California wishing on the stars &lt;br&gt; For you're heart on me &lt;br&gt; My California king &lt;br&gt; My California King &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In this California king bed &lt;br&gt; Were 10000 miles apart &lt;br&gt; I'll be California wishing on the stars &lt;br&gt; For you're heart on me &lt;br&gt; My California king &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

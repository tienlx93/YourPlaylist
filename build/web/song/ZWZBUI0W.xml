    <Lyrics>I can see the pain living in your eyes&lt;br&gt; And I know how hard you try&lt;br&gt; You deserve to have so much more&lt;br&gt; I can feel your heart and I sympathize&lt;br&gt; And I'll never criticize&lt;br&gt; All you've ever meant to my life&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't want to let you down&lt;br&gt; I don't want to lead you on&lt;br&gt; I don't want to hold you back&lt;br&gt; From where you might belong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You would never ask me why&lt;br&gt; My heart is so disguised&lt;br&gt; I just can't live a lie anymore&lt;br&gt; I would rather hurt myself&lt;br&gt; Than to ever make you cry&lt;br&gt; There's nothing left to say but good-bye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You deserve the chance at the kind of love&lt;br&gt; I'm not sure I'm worthy of&lt;br&gt; [ From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/a/air-supply-lyrics/goodbye-lyrics.html ]&lt;br&gt; Losing you is painful to me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't want to let you down&lt;br&gt; I don't want to lead you on&lt;br&gt; I don't want to hold you back&lt;br&gt; From where you might belong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You would never ask me why&lt;br&gt; My heart is so disguised&lt;br&gt; I just can't live a lie anymore&lt;br&gt; I would rather hurt myself&lt;br&gt; Than to ever make you cry&lt;br&gt; There's nothing left to say but good-bye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You would never ask me why&lt;br&gt; My heart is so disguised&lt;br&gt; I just can't live a lie anymore&lt;br&gt; I would rather hurt myself&lt;br&gt; Than to ever make you cry&lt;br&gt; There's nothing left to try&lt;br&gt; Though it's gonna hurt us both&lt;br&gt; There's no other way than to say good-bye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

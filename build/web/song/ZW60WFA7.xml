    <Lyrics>Why do birds suddenly appear&lt;br&gt; Everytime you are near?&lt;br&gt; Just like me, they long to be&lt;br&gt; Close to you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Why do stars fall down from the sky&lt;br&gt; Every time you walk by?&lt;br&gt; Just like me, they long to be&lt;br&gt; Close to you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; On the day that you were born&lt;br&gt; The angels got together&lt;br&gt; And decided to create a dream come true&lt;br&gt; So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold&lt;br&gt; And starlight in your eyes of blue.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; That is why all the girls (boys) in town&lt;br&gt; Follow you all around.&lt;br&gt; Just like me, they long to be&lt;br&gt; Close to you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; On the day that you were born&lt;br&gt; The angels got together&lt;br&gt; And decided to create a dream come true&lt;br&gt; So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold&lt;br&gt; And starlight in your eyes of blue.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; That is why all the girls (boys) in town&lt;br&gt; Follow you all around.&lt;br&gt; Just like me, they long to be&lt;br&gt; Close to you.&lt;br&gt; Just like me (Just like me)&lt;br&gt; They long to be&lt;br&gt; Close to you.</Lyrics>

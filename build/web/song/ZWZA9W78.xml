    <Lyrics>I know that the bridges that I've burned&lt;br&gt; Along the way&lt;br&gt; Have left me with these walls and these scars&lt;br&gt; That won't go away&lt;br&gt; And opening up has always been the hardest thing&lt;br&gt; Until you came&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; So lay here beside me just hold me and don't let go&lt;br&gt; This feelin' I'm feelin' is somethin' I've never known&lt;br&gt; And I just can't take my eyes off you&lt;br&gt; And I just can't take my eyes off you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I love when you tell me that I'm pretty&lt;br&gt; When I just wake up&lt;br&gt; And I love how you tease me when I'm moody&lt;br&gt; But it's never too much&lt;br&gt; I'm falling fast and the truth is I'm not scared at all&lt;br&gt; You climbed my walls&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Off you&lt;br&gt; Off you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So lay here beside me just hold me and don't let go&lt;br&gt; Oh.. this feelin I'm feelin is somethin' I've never known&lt;br&gt; And I just can't take my eyes of you&lt;br&gt; And I just can't take my eyes of you</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark&lt;br&gt; Can’t be sure when they’ve hit their mark, mark&lt;br&gt; And besides in the meantime I’m just dreaming of tearing you apart&lt;br&gt; I'm in the details with the devil&lt;br&gt; So now the world can never get me on my level&lt;br&gt; I just got to get you out of the cage&lt;br&gt; I'm a young lover's rage&lt;br&gt; Gonna need a spark to ignite&lt;br&gt; My songs know what you did in the dark&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So light em up, light em up, light em up&lt;br&gt; I’m on fire&lt;br&gt; So light em up, light em up, light em up&lt;br&gt; I’m on fire&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (In the dark, dark&lt;br&gt; In the dark, dark)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; All the writers keep writing what they write&lt;br&gt; Somewhere another pretty vein just dies&lt;br&gt; I’ve got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see&lt;br&gt; That you’re the antidote to everything except for me&lt;br&gt; A constellation of tears on your lashes&lt;br&gt; Burn everything you love&lt;br&gt; Then burn the ashes&lt;br&gt; In the end everything collides&lt;br&gt; My childhood spat back the monster that you see&lt;br&gt; My songs know what you did in the dark&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So light em up, light em up, light em up&lt;br&gt; I’m on fire&lt;br&gt; So light em up, light em up, light em up&lt;br&gt; I’m on fire&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (In the dark, dark&lt;br&gt; In the dark, dark)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; My songs know what you did in the dark&lt;br&gt; My songs know what you did in the dark&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So light em up, light em up, light em up&lt;br&gt; I’m on fire&lt;br&gt; So light em up, light em up, light em up&lt;br&gt; I’m on fire&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (In the dark, dark&lt;br&gt; In the dark, dark)</Lyrics>

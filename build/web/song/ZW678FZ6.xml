    <Lyrics>It's not your eyes &lt;br&gt; It's not what you say &lt;br&gt; It's not your laughter that gives you away &lt;br&gt; You're just lonely &lt;br&gt; You've been lonely, too long &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; All your actin' &lt;br&gt; Your thin disguise &lt;br&gt; All your perfectly delivered lies &lt;br&gt; They don't fool me &lt;br&gt; You've been lonely, too long &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Chorus: &lt;br&gt; Let me in the wall, you've built around &lt;br&gt; And we can light a match and burn it down &lt;br&gt; Let me hold your hand and dance 'round and 'round the flame &lt;br&gt; In front of us &lt;br&gt; Dust to ... &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You've held your head up &lt;br&gt; You've fought the fight &lt;br&gt; You bear the scars &lt;br&gt; You've done your time &lt;br&gt; Listen to me- &lt;br&gt; You've been lonely, too long &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Chorus: &lt;br&gt; Let me in the wall, you've built around &lt;br&gt; And we can light a match and burn them down &lt;br&gt; And let me hold your hand and dance 'round and 'round the flames &lt;br&gt; In front of us &lt;br&gt; Dust to Dust... &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You're like a mirror, reflecting me &lt;br&gt; Takes one to know one, so take it from me &lt;br&gt; You've been lonely &lt;br&gt; You've been lonely, too long &lt;br&gt; We've been lonely &lt;br&gt; We've been lonely, too long</Lyrics>

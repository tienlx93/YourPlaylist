    <Lyrics>[Brad]&lt;br&gt; We didn't care if people stared&lt;br&gt; We'd make out in a crowd somewhere&lt;br&gt; Somebody'd tell us to get a room&lt;br&gt; It's hard to believe that was me and you&lt;br&gt; Now we keep saying that we're OK&lt;br&gt; But I don't want to settle for good not great&lt;br&gt; I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Brad] Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck&lt;br&gt; [Carrie] Remind me, remind me&lt;br&gt; [Brad] So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough&lt;br&gt; [Carrie] Remind me, remind me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Carrie]&lt;br&gt; Remember the airport dropping me off&lt;br&gt; We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop&lt;br&gt; [Brad] I felt bad cause you missed your flight&lt;br&gt; [Carrie and Brad] But that meant we had one more night&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Carrie]&lt;br&gt; Do you remember how it used to be&lt;br&gt; We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep&lt;br&gt; [Brad] Remind me, baby, remind me&lt;br&gt; [Carrie]&lt;br&gt; Oh, so on fire so in love&lt;br&gt; That look in your eyes that I miss so much&lt;br&gt; [Brad] Remind me, baby, remind me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Brad] I wanna feel that way&lt;br&gt; [Carrie] Yeah, I wanna hold you close&lt;br&gt; [Brad and Carrie]&lt;br&gt; Oh, if you still love me&lt;br&gt; Don't just assume I know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Carrie] Baby, remind me, remind me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Carrie] Do you remember the way it felt?&lt;br&gt; [Brad] You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves&lt;br&gt; [Carrie] Remind me&lt;br&gt; [Brad] Yeah, remind me&lt;br&gt; [Carrie]&lt;br&gt; All those things that you used to do&lt;br&gt; That made me fall in love with you&lt;br&gt; Remind me, oh, baby, remind me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Brad]&lt;br&gt; Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt&lt;br&gt; All those mornings I was late for work&lt;br&gt; Remind me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Brad and Carrie] Oh, baby, remind me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Carrie] Oh, baby, remind me, baby, remind me&lt;br&gt; [Brad] Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt&lt;br&gt; [Carrie] Oh, yeah, remind me&lt;br&gt; [Brad] Baby, remind me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

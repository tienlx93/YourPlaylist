    <Lyrics>There's a place in your heart, and I know that it is love&lt;br&gt; And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow&lt;br&gt; And if you really try, you'll find there's no need to cry&lt;br&gt; In this place you'll feel, there's no hurt or sorrow&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There are ways to get there&lt;br&gt; If you care enough for the living&lt;br&gt; Make a little space, make a better place&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; * Heal the world make it a better place&lt;br&gt; For you and for me and the entire human race&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; ** There are people dying if you care enough for the living&lt;br&gt; Make a better place for you and for me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you want to know why, there's a love that cannot lie&lt;br&gt; Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving if we try&lt;br&gt; We shall see in this bliss, we cannot feel fear or dread&lt;br&gt; We stop existing and start living&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Then it feels that always love's enough for us growing&lt;br&gt; So make a better world, make a better world&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Repeat * , **]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And the dream we were conceived In will reveal a joyful face&lt;br&gt; And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace&lt;br&gt; Then why do we keep strangling life wound this earth crucify&lt;br&gt; Its soul though it's plain to see this world is heavenly be God's glow&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We could fly so high let our spirits never die in my heart&lt;br&gt; I feel you are all my brothers create a world with no fear&lt;br&gt; Together we'll cry happy tears see the nations turn&lt;br&gt; Their swords into plowshares&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We could really get there if you cared enough for the living&lt;br&gt; Make a little space, to make a better place</Lyrics>

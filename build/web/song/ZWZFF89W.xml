    <Lyrics>Another day has gone&lt;br&gt; I'm still all alone&lt;br&gt; How could this be&lt;br&gt; You're not here with me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You never said goodbye&lt;br&gt; Someone tell me why&lt;br&gt; Did you have to go&lt;br&gt; And leave my world so cold&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Everyday I sit and ask myself&lt;br&gt; How did love slip away&lt;br&gt; Something whispers in my ear and says&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; That you are not alone&lt;br&gt; For I am here with you&lt;br&gt; Though you're far away&lt;br&gt; I am here to stay&lt;br&gt; For you are not alone&lt;br&gt; I am here with you&lt;br&gt; Though we're far apart&lt;br&gt; You're always in my heart&lt;br&gt; For you are not alone, alone, why&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just the other night&lt;br&gt; I thought I heard you cry&lt;br&gt; Asking me to come&lt;br&gt; And hold you in my arms&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can hear your prayers&lt;br&gt; Your burdens I will bear&lt;br&gt; But first I need your hand&lt;br&gt; Then forever can begin&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Everyday I sit and ask myself&lt;br&gt; How did love slip away&lt;br&gt; Something whispers in my ear and says&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are not alone&lt;br&gt; For I am here with you&lt;br&gt; Though you're far away&lt;br&gt; I am here to stay&lt;br&gt; For you are not alone&lt;br&gt; I am here with you&lt;br&gt; Though we're far apart&lt;br&gt; You're always in my heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; For you are not alone&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Whisper three words then I'll come running&lt;br&gt; And boy you know that I'll be there&lt;br&gt; I'll be there&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are not alone&lt;br&gt; For I am here with you&lt;br&gt; Though you're far away&lt;br&gt; I am here to stay&lt;br&gt; For you are not alone&lt;br&gt; I am here with you&lt;br&gt; Though we're far apart&lt;br&gt; You're always in my heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are not alone&lt;br&gt; I am here with you&lt;br&gt; Though we're far away&lt;br&gt; I am here to stay&lt;br&gt; You are not alone&lt;br&gt; I am here with you&lt;br&gt; Though we're far apart&lt;br&gt; You're always in my heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; For you are not alone&lt;br&gt; You are not alone...</Lyrics>

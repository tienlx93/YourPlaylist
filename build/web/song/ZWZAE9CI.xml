    <Lyrics>If I got down on my knees and I pleaded with you,&lt;br&gt; if I crossed a million oceans just to be with you,&lt;br&gt; Would you ever let me down?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I climbed the highest mountain just to hold you tight,&lt;br&gt; if I said that I would love you every single night,&lt;br&gt; Would you ever let me down?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well, I'm sorry if it sounds kinds sad,&lt;br&gt; it's just that I'm worried,&lt;br&gt; so worried that you'll let me down.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because I love you, love you, love you, so don't let me down.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I swam the longest river just to call your name,&lt;br&gt; if I said the way I feel for you would never change,&lt;br&gt; Would you ever fool around?&lt;br&gt; Well, I'm sorry if it sounds kinds bad, it's just that I'm worried,&lt;br&gt; I'm so worried that you'll let me down.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because I(love you, love you), love you, love you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well I'm sorry if it sounds kinds bad, it's just that I'm worried,&lt;br&gt; Yes, I'm so worried that you'll let me down.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because I love you, love you,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oooh, I love you, love you, love you.</Lyrics>

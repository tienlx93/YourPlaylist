    <Lyrics>This ain't a song for the broken-hearted &lt;br&gt; No silent prayer for the faith-departed &lt;br&gt; I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd &lt;br&gt; You're gonna hear my voice &lt;br&gt; When I shout it out loud &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; It's my life &lt;br&gt; It's now or never &lt;br&gt; I ain't gonna live forever &lt;br&gt; I just want to live while I'm alive &lt;br&gt; (It's my life) &lt;br&gt; My heart is like an open highway &lt;br&gt; Like Frankie said &lt;br&gt; I did it my way &lt;br&gt; I just wanna live while I'm alive &lt;br&gt; It's my life &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This is for the ones who stood their ground &lt;br&gt; For Tommy and Gina who never backed down &lt;br&gt; Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake &lt;br&gt; Luck ain't even lucky &lt;br&gt; Got to make your own breaks &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; It's my life &lt;br&gt; And it's now or never &lt;br&gt; I ain't gonna live forever &lt;br&gt; I just want to live while I'm alive &lt;br&gt; (It's my life) &lt;br&gt; My heart is like an open highway &lt;br&gt; Like Frankie said &lt;br&gt; I did it my way &lt;br&gt; I just want to live while I'm alive &lt;br&gt; 'Cause it's my life &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Better stand tall when they're calling you out &lt;br&gt; Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; It's my life &lt;br&gt; And it's now or never &lt;br&gt; 'Cause I ain't gonna live forever &lt;br&gt; I just want to live while I'm alive &lt;br&gt; (It's my life) &lt;br&gt; My heart is like an open highway &lt;br&gt; Like Frankie said &lt;br&gt; I did it my way &lt;br&gt; I just want to live while I'm alive &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; It's my life &lt;br&gt; And it's now or never &lt;br&gt; 'Cause I ain't gonna live forever &lt;br&gt; I just want to live while I'm alive &lt;br&gt; (It's my life) &lt;br&gt; My heart is like an open highway &lt;br&gt; Like Frankie said &lt;br&gt; I did it my way &lt;br&gt; I just want to live while I'm alive&lt;br&gt; 'Cause it's my life!</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I'm sitting here in the boring room&lt;br&gt; It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon&lt;br&gt; I'm wasting my time&lt;br&gt; I got nothing to do&lt;br&gt; I'm hanging around&lt;br&gt; I'm waiting for you&lt;br&gt; But nothing ever happens and I wonder&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm driving around in my car&lt;br&gt; I'm driving too fast&lt;br&gt; I'm driving too far&lt;br&gt; I'd like to change my point of view&lt;br&gt; I feel so lonely&lt;br&gt; I'm waiting for you&lt;br&gt; But nothing ever happens and I wonder&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I wonder how&lt;br&gt; I wonder why&lt;br&gt; Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky&lt;br&gt; And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree&lt;br&gt; I'm turning my head up and down&lt;br&gt; I'm turning turning turning turning turning around&lt;br&gt; And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm sitting here&lt;br&gt; I miss the power&lt;br&gt; I'd like to go out taking a shower&lt;br&gt; But there's a heavy cloud inside my head&lt;br&gt; I feel so tired&lt;br&gt; Put myself into bed&lt;br&gt; Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Isolation is not good for me&lt;br&gt; Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon-tree&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy&lt;br&gt; Baby anyhow I'll get another toy&lt;br&gt; And everything will happen and you wonder&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I wonder how&lt;br&gt; I wonder why&lt;br&gt; Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky&lt;br&gt; And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree&lt;br&gt; I'm turning my head up and down&lt;br&gt; I'm turning turning turning turning turning around&lt;br&gt; And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree&lt;br&gt; And I wonder, wonder&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I wonder how&lt;br&gt; I wonder why&lt;br&gt; Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky&lt;br&gt; And all that I can see, and all that I can see, and all that I can see&lt;br&gt; Is just a yellow lemon-tree&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

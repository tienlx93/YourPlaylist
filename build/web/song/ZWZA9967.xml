    <Lyrics>When I was was young I'd listen to the radio&lt;br&gt; Waiting for my favourite songs&lt;br&gt; When they played I'd sing along&lt;br&gt; It made me smile.&lt;br&gt; Those were such happy times and not so long ago&lt;br&gt; How I wondered where they've gone&lt;br&gt; But they're back again&lt;br&gt; Just like a long lost friend all the songs I love so well.&lt;br&gt; Ev'ry sha-la-la-la, ev'ry wo-o-wo-o still shines.&lt;br&gt; Ev'ry shing-a-ling-a-ling&lt;br&gt; That they're startin' to sing so fine.&lt;br&gt; When they get to the part where he's breaking her heart&lt;br&gt; It can really make me cry just like before&lt;br&gt; It's yesterday once more.&lt;br&gt; Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by&lt;br&gt; And the good times that I had makes today seem rather sad&lt;br&gt; So much has changed.&lt;br&gt; It was songs of love that I would sing to them&lt;br&gt; And I'd memorize each word&lt;br&gt; Those old melodies still sound so good to me&lt;br&gt; As they melt the years away.&lt;br&gt; All my best memories come back clearly to me&lt;br&gt; Some can even make me cry&lt;br&gt; Just like before it's yesterday once more</Lyrics>

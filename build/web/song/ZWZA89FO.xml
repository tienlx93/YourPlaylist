    <Lyrics>Listen,&lt;br&gt; To the song here in my heart&lt;br&gt; A melody I've start&lt;br&gt; But can't complete&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Listen, to the sound from deep within&lt;br&gt; It's only beginning&lt;br&gt; To find release&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh,&lt;br&gt; the time has come&lt;br&gt; for my dreams to be heard&lt;br&gt; They will not be pushed aside and turned&lt;br&gt; Into your own&lt;br&gt; all cause you won't&lt;br&gt; Listen....&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Listen,&lt;br&gt; I am alone at a crossroads&lt;br&gt; I'm not at home, in my own home&lt;br&gt; And I tried and tried&lt;br&gt; To say whats on my mind&lt;br&gt; You should have known&lt;br&gt; Oh,&lt;br&gt; Now I'm done believing you&lt;br&gt; You don't know what I'm feeling&lt;br&gt; I'm more than what, you made of me&lt;br&gt; I followed the voice&lt;br&gt; you gave to me&lt;br&gt; But now I gotta find, my own..&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You should have listened&lt;br&gt; There is someone here inside&lt;br&gt; Someone I'd thought had died&lt;br&gt; So long ago&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh I'm screaming out, for my dreams to be heard&lt;br&gt; They will not be pushed aside or worse&lt;br&gt; Into your own&lt;br&gt; All cause you won't&lt;br&gt; Listen...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't know where I belong&lt;br&gt; But I'll be moving on&lt;br&gt; If you don't....&lt;br&gt; If you won't....&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; LISTEN!!!...&lt;br&gt; To the song here in my heart&lt;br&gt; A melody I've start&lt;br&gt; But I will complete&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh,&lt;br&gt; Now I'm done believing you&lt;br&gt; You don't know what I'm feeling&lt;br&gt; I'm more than what, you made of me&lt;br&gt; I followed the voice, you think you gave to me&lt;br&gt; But now I gotta find, my own..&lt;br&gt; my ownn...&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

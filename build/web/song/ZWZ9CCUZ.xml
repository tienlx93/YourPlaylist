    <Lyrics>Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain&lt;br&gt; Telling me just what a fool I've been&lt;br&gt; I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain&lt;br&gt; And let me be alone again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The only girl I care about has gone away&lt;br&gt; Looking for a brand new start&lt;br&gt; But little does she know&lt;br&gt; That when she left that day&lt;br&gt; Along with her she took my heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Rain please tell me now does that seem fair&lt;br&gt; For her to steal my heart away when she don't care&lt;br&gt; I can't love another when my hearts somewhere far away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The only girl I care about has gone away&lt;br&gt; Looking for a brand new start&lt;br&gt; But little does she know that when she left that day&lt;br&gt; Along with her she took my heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Instrumental Interlude]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Rain won't you tell her that I love her so&lt;br&gt; Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow&lt;br&gt; Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain&lt;br&gt; Telling me just what a fool I've been&lt;br&gt; I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain&lt;br&gt; And let me be alone again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, listen to the falling rain&lt;br&gt; Pitter pater, pitter pater&lt;br&gt; Oh, oh, oh, listen to the falling rain&lt;br&gt; Pitter pater, pitter pater</Lyrics>

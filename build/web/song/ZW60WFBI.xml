    <Lyrics>I've heard there was a secret chord&lt;br&gt; That David played, and it pleased the Lord&lt;br&gt; But you don't really care for music, do you?&lt;br&gt; It goes like this&lt;br&gt; The fourth, the fifth&lt;br&gt; The minor fall, the major lift&lt;br&gt; The baffled king composing Hallelujah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Your faith was strong but you needed proof&lt;br&gt; You saw her bathing on the roof&lt;br&gt; Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you&lt;br&gt; She tied you to a kitchen chair&lt;br&gt; She broke your throne, and she cut your hair&lt;br&gt; And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Baby I have been here before&lt;br&gt; I know this room, I've walked this floor&lt;br&gt; I used to live alone before I knew you.&lt;br&gt; I've seen your flag on the marble arch&lt;br&gt; Love is not a victory march&lt;br&gt; It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I did my best, it wasn't much&lt;br&gt; I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch&lt;br&gt; I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you&lt;br&gt; And even though it all went wrong&lt;br&gt; I'll stand before the Lord of Song&lt;br&gt; With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah</Lyrics>

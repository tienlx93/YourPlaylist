    <Lyrics>&quot;All Of The Stars&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's just another night and I'm staring at the moon&lt;br&gt; I saw a shooting star and thought of you&lt;br&gt; I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew&lt;br&gt; If you were here, I'd sing to you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You're on the other side&lt;br&gt; As the skyline splits in two&lt;br&gt; Miles away from seeing you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I can see the stars from America&lt;br&gt; I wonder, do you see them too?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So open your eyes and see&lt;br&gt; The way our horizons meet&lt;br&gt; And all of the lights will lead&lt;br&gt; Into the night with me&lt;br&gt; And I know these scars will bleed&lt;br&gt; But both of our hearts believe&lt;br&gt; All of these stars will guide us home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can hear your heart on the radio beat&lt;br&gt; They're playing &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; and I thought of us&lt;br&gt; Back to the time you were lying next to me&lt;br&gt; I looked across and fell in love&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I took your hand&lt;br&gt; Back through lamp-lit streets and knew&lt;br&gt; Everything led back to you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?&lt;br&gt; Hear the song my heart is beating to&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So open your eyes and see&lt;br&gt; The way our horizons meet&lt;br&gt; And all of the lights will leave&lt;br&gt; Into the night with me&lt;br&gt; And I know these scars will bleed&lt;br&gt; But both of our hearts believe&lt;br&gt; All of these stars will guide us home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And oh&lt;br&gt; And oh&lt;br&gt; And oh whoa&lt;br&gt; I can see the stars from America.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Nguá»“n: http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/edsheeran/allofthestars.html</Lyrics>

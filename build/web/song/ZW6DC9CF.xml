    <Lyrics>I never thought you'd pick up the phone&lt;br&gt; It's Friday night you should be at home at town&lt;br&gt; Didn't think you'd be sitting at home all alone like me&lt;br&gt; Nothing on TV, nothing to do&lt;br&gt; Nothing to keep my mind off you and me&lt;br&gt; And the way it was&lt;br&gt; Are you thinking 'bout it now because&lt;br&gt; I could be there in five&lt;br&gt; One more one last time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We don't have to be lonely tonight&lt;br&gt; Need you, want you, I'm right here&lt;br&gt; We don't have to be lonely tonight&lt;br&gt; I know we shouldn't, but I don't care&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong&lt;br&gt; I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone&lt;br&gt; When the sun comes up, we can both move on&lt;br&gt; But we don't have to be lonely tonight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; That taste, that touch, the fire I miss&lt;br&gt; Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips, oh my&lt;br&gt; I can use to be, baby I want you, and you want me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We don't have to be lonely tonight&lt;br&gt; Need you, want you, I'm right here&lt;br&gt; We don't have to be lonely tonight&lt;br&gt; I know we shouldn't, but I don't care&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong&lt;br&gt; I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone&lt;br&gt; When the sun comes up, we can both move on&lt;br&gt; But we don't have to be lonely tonight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can be there in five&lt;br&gt; One more one last time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We don't have to be lonely tonight&lt;br&gt; Need you, want you, I'm right here&lt;br&gt; We don't have to be lonely tonight&lt;br&gt; I know we shouldn't, but I don't care&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong&lt;br&gt; I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone&lt;br&gt; When the sun comes up, we can both move on&lt;br&gt; But we don't have to be lonely tonight</Lyrics>

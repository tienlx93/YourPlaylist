    <Lyrics>First I was afraid&lt;br&gt; I was petrified&lt;br&gt; Kept thinking I could never live&lt;br&gt; without you by my side&lt;br&gt; But I spent so many nights&lt;br&gt; thinking how you did me wrong&lt;br&gt; I grew strong&lt;br&gt; I learned how to carry on&lt;br&gt; and so you're back&lt;br&gt; from outer space&lt;br&gt; I just walked in to find you here&lt;br&gt; with that sad look upon your face&lt;br&gt; I should have changed my stupid lock&lt;br&gt; I should have made you leave your key&lt;br&gt; If I had known for just one second&lt;br&gt; you'd be back to bother me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Go on now go walk out the door&lt;br&gt; just turn around now&lt;br&gt; 'cause you're not welcome anymore&lt;br&gt; weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye&lt;br&gt; you think I'd crumble&lt;br&gt; you think I'd lay down and die&lt;br&gt; Oh no, not I&lt;br&gt; I will survive&lt;br&gt; as long as i know how to love&lt;br&gt; I know I will stay alive&lt;br&gt; I've got all my life to live&lt;br&gt; I've got all my love to give&lt;br&gt; and I'll survive&lt;br&gt; I will survive&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It took all the strength I had&lt;br&gt; not to fall apart&lt;br&gt; kept trying hard to mend&lt;br&gt; the pieces of my broken heart&lt;br&gt; and I spent oh so many nights&lt;br&gt; just feeling sorry for myself&lt;br&gt; I used to cry&lt;br&gt; Now I hold my head up high&lt;br&gt; and you see me&lt;br&gt; somebody new&lt;br&gt; I'm not that chained up little person&lt;br&gt; still in love with you&lt;br&gt; and so you felt like dropping in&lt;br&gt; and just expect me to be free&lt;br&gt; now I'm saving all my loving&lt;br&gt; for someone who's loving me</Lyrics>

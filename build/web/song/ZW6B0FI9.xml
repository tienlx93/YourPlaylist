    <Lyrics>The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake&lt;br&gt; A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride&lt;br&gt; The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think&lt;br&gt; So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right&lt;br&gt; The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back&lt;br&gt; Yeah you can find us where the party's at&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; We hanging round singing out everything on the radio&lt;br&gt; We light it up with our hands up&lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; This is how we do&lt;br&gt; We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby&lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah baby this is how we roll&lt;br&gt; We rollin' into town&lt;br&gt; With nothing else to do we take another lap around&lt;br&gt; Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride&lt;br&gt; If you roll with me yeah you know we rollin' high&lt;br&gt; Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though&lt;br&gt; How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh&lt;br&gt; Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw&lt;br&gt; This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though&lt;br&gt; Let's roll!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; We hanging round singing out everything on the radio&lt;br&gt; We light it up with our hands up&lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; This is how we do&lt;br&gt; When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you baby&lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Luke Bryan:]&lt;br&gt; Yeah we're proud to be young&lt;br&gt; We stick to our guns&lt;br&gt; We love who we love and we wanna have fun&lt;br&gt; Yeah we cuss on them Mondays&lt;br&gt; And pray on them Sundays&lt;br&gt; Pass it around and we dream about one day&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; We hanging round singing out everything on the radio&lt;br&gt; We light it up with our hands up&lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; This is how we ride&lt;br&gt; We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside baby&lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah this is how we roll&lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; This is how we do&lt;br&gt; We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby&lt;br&gt; This is how we roll&lt;br&gt; Yeah this is how we roll</Lyrics>

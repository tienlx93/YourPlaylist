    <Lyrics>Well you only need the light when it's burning low&lt;br&gt; Only miss the sun when it starts to snow&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; Only know you've been high when you're feeling low&lt;br&gt; Only hate the road when you're missing home&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; And you let her go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Staring at the bottom of your glass&lt;br&gt; Hoping one day you'll make a dream last&lt;br&gt; But dreams come slow and they go so fast&lt;br&gt; You see her when you close your eyes&lt;br&gt; Maybe one day you'll understand why&lt;br&gt; Everything you touch surely dies&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But you only need the light when it's burning low&lt;br&gt; Only miss the sun when it starts to snow&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; Only know you've been high when you're feeling low&lt;br&gt; Only hate the road when you're missing home&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Staring at the ceiling in the dark&lt;br&gt; Same old empty feeling in your heart&lt;br&gt; 'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast&lt;br&gt; Well you see her when you fall asleep&lt;br&gt; But never to touch and never to keep&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well you only need the light when it's burning low&lt;br&gt; Only miss the sun when it starts to snow&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; Only know you've been high when you're feeling low&lt;br&gt; Only hate the road when you're missing home&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; And you let her go&lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh no&lt;br&gt; And you let her go&lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh no&lt;br&gt; Well you let her go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low&lt;br&gt; Only miss the sun when it starts to snow&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; Only know you've been high when you're feeling low&lt;br&gt; Only hate the road when you're missing home&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low&lt;br&gt; Only miss the sun when it starts to snow&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; Only know you've been high when you're feeling low&lt;br&gt; Only hate the road when you're missing home&lt;br&gt; Only know you love her when you let her go&lt;br&gt; And you let her go</Lyrics>

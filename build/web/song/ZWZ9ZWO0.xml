    <Lyrics>I'm holding on your rope&lt;br&gt; Got me ten feet off the ground&lt;br&gt; And I'm hearing what you say&lt;br&gt; But I just can't make a sound&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You tell me that you need me&lt;br&gt; Then you go and cut me down, but wait&lt;br&gt; You tell me that you're sorry&lt;br&gt; Didn't think I'd turn around and say&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; That it's too late to apologize, it's too late&lt;br&gt; I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'd take another chance, take a fall&lt;br&gt; Take a shot for you&lt;br&gt; And I need you like a heart needs a beat&lt;br&gt; But that's nothing new, yeah yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue&lt;br&gt; And you say sorry like the angel&lt;br&gt; Heaven let me think was you&lt;br&gt; But I'm afraid&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's too late to apologize, it's too late&lt;br&gt; I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late, whoa whoa&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's too late to apologize, it's too late&lt;br&gt; I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I said it's too late to apologize, yeah&lt;br&gt; I said it's too late to apologize, yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm holding on your rope&lt;br&gt; Got me ten feet off the ground</Lyrics>

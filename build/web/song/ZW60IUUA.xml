    <Lyrics>I can't forget you when you're gone&lt;br&gt; You're like a song that goes around in my head&lt;br&gt; And how I regret, it's been so long&lt;br&gt; Oh, what went wrong? Could it be something I said?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Time, make it go faster or just rewind&lt;br&gt; To back when I'm wrapped in your arms&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; All afternoon long it's with me the same song&lt;br&gt; You left a light on inside me, my love&lt;br&gt; I can remember the way that it felt to be&lt;br&gt; Holding on to you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can't forget you when you're gone&lt;br&gt; You're like a song that goes around in my head&lt;br&gt; And how I regret, it's been so long&lt;br&gt; Oh what went wrong? Could it be something I said?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Time, make it go faster or just decide&lt;br&gt; To come back to my happy heart</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low&lt;br&gt; Put some music on that's soft and slow&lt;br&gt; Baby we ain't got no place to go&lt;br&gt; I hope you understand&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've been thinking 'bout this all day long&lt;br&gt; Never felt a feeling quite this strong&lt;br&gt; I can't believe how much it turns me on&lt;br&gt; Just to be your man&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There's no hurry&lt;br&gt; Don't you worry we can take our time&lt;br&gt; Come a little closer&lt;br&gt; Let's go over what I had in mind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low&lt;br&gt; Put some music on that's soft and slow&lt;br&gt; Baby we ain't got no place to go&lt;br&gt; I hope you understand&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've been thinking 'bout this all day long&lt;br&gt; Never felt a feeling quite this strong&lt;br&gt; I can't believe how much it turns me on&lt;br&gt; Just to be your man&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ain't nobody ever love nobody&lt;br&gt; The way that I love you&lt;br&gt; We're alone now&lt;br&gt; You don't know how long I've wanted to&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Lock the door and turn the lights down low&lt;br&gt; Put some music on that's soft and slow&lt;br&gt; Baby we ain't got no place to go&lt;br&gt; I hope you understand&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've been thinking 'bout this all day long&lt;br&gt; Never felt a feeling that was quite this strong&lt;br&gt; I can't believe how much it turns me on&lt;br&gt; Just to be your man&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can't believe how much it turns me on&lt;br&gt; Just to be your man</Lyrics>

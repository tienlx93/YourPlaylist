    <Lyrics>[Verse 1:]&lt;br&gt; Want to, but I can’t help it&lt;br&gt; I love the way it feels,&lt;br&gt; It’s got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real&lt;br&gt; I need it when I want it, I want it when I don’t&lt;br&gt; Tell myself I’ll stop everyday, knowin’ that I won't&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge:]&lt;br&gt; I got a problem and I don’t know what to do about it&lt;br&gt; Even if I did, I don’t know if I would quit but I doubt it&lt;br&gt; I’m taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true&lt;br&gt; Baby, you have become my addiction, I’m so strung out on you&lt;br&gt; I can barely move but I like it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; And it’s all because of you [3X]&lt;br&gt; And it’s all because…&lt;br&gt; Never get enough,&lt;br&gt; She’s the sweetest drug&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2:]&lt;br&gt; Think of it every second&lt;br&gt; I can't get nothing done,&lt;br&gt; Only concern is the next time, I’m gonna get me some&lt;br&gt; Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me&lt;br&gt; I try and try but my obsession wont let me leave&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge:]&lt;br&gt; I got a problem and I don’t know what to do about it&lt;br&gt; Even if I did, I don’t know if I would quit but I doubt it&lt;br&gt; I’m taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true&lt;br&gt; Baby, you have become my addiction, I’m so strung out on you&lt;br&gt; I can barely move but I like it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; And it’s all because of you (all because of you) [3X]&lt;br&gt; And it’s all because…&lt;br&gt; Never get enough,&lt;br&gt; She’s the sweetest drug&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ain’t no doubt, so strung out [2X]&lt;br&gt; Over you, over you, over you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because of you,&lt;br&gt; And it’s all because of you,&lt;br&gt; Never get enough&lt;br&gt; She’s the sweetest drug, she’s the sweetest drug</Lyrics>

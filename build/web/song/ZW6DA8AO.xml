    <Lyrics>As a child, you would&lt;br&gt; wait and watch from far away.&lt;br&gt; But you always knew that you'd be&lt;br&gt; the one that work while they all play.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And youth, you'd lay, awake at night and&lt;br&gt; scheme, of all the things you that would change,&lt;br&gt; but it was just a dream.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Here we are, don't turn away now,&lt;br&gt; we are the warriors that built this town.&lt;br&gt; Here we are, don't turn away now,&lt;br&gt; we are the warriors that built this town from dust.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This time will come when you will have to rise,&lt;br&gt; Above the best and prove yourself your spirit&lt;br&gt; never dies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above&lt;br&gt; But don't weep for me, cause this will be the&lt;br&gt; labor of my love.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Here we are, don't turn away now,&lt;br&gt; we are the warriors that built this town.&lt;br&gt; Here we are, don't turn away now,&lt;br&gt; we are the warriors that built this town from dust.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Here we are, don't turn away now,&lt;br&gt; we are the warriors that built this town.&lt;br&gt; Here we are, don't turn away now,&lt;br&gt; we are the warriors that built this town from dust.</Lyrics>

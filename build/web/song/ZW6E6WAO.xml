    <Lyrics>You got me sippin' on something&lt;br&gt; I can't compare to nothing&lt;br&gt; I bet for known I'm hoping&lt;br&gt; That after this fever I'll survive&lt;br&gt; I know I'm acting a bit crazy&lt;br&gt; Strung out, a little bit hazy&lt;br&gt; Hand over heart, I'm praying&lt;br&gt; That I'm gonna make it out alive&lt;br&gt; The bed's getting cold and you're not here&lt;br&gt; The future that we hold is so unclear&lt;br&gt; But I'm not alive until you call&lt;br&gt; And I'll bet the odds against it all&lt;br&gt; Save your advice 'cause I won't hear&lt;br&gt; You might be right, but I don't care&lt;br&gt; There's a million reasons why I should give you up&lt;br&gt; But the heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; The heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; You got me scattered in pieces&lt;br&gt; Shining like stars and screaming&lt;br&gt; Lightining me up like Venus&lt;br&gt; But then you disappear and make me wait&lt;br&gt; And every second's like torture&lt;br&gt; Hell won't endure no more, so&lt;br&gt; Finding a way to let go&lt;br&gt; Baby, baby, no, I can't escape&lt;br&gt; The bed's getting cold and you're not here&lt;br&gt; The future that we hold is so unclear&lt;br&gt; But I'm not alive until you call&lt;br&gt; And I'll bet the odds against it all&lt;br&gt; Save your advice 'cause I won't hear&lt;br&gt; You might be right, but I don't care&lt;br&gt; There's a million reasons why I should give you up&lt;br&gt; But the heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; The heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; The heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; The heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; This is a modern fairytale&lt;br&gt; No happy endings&lt;br&gt; No wind in ourselves&lt;br&gt; But I can't imagine a life without&lt;br&gt; The bretheless moments&lt;br&gt; Breaking me down&lt;br&gt; The bed's getting cold and you're not here&lt;br&gt; The future that we hold is so unclear&lt;br&gt; But I'm not alive until you call&lt;br&gt; And I'll bet the odds against it all&lt;br&gt; Save your advice 'cause I won't hear&lt;br&gt; You might be right, but I don't care&lt;br&gt; There's a million reasons why I should give you up&lt;br&gt; But the heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; The heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; The heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; The heart wants what it wants&lt;br&gt; The heart wants what it wants, baby&lt;br&gt; It wants what it wants, baby</Lyrics>

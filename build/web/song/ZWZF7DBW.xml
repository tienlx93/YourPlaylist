    <Lyrics>Escaping nights without you with shadows on the wall&lt;br&gt; My mind is running wild tryin hard not to fall&lt;br&gt; You tell me that you love me but say Im just a friend&lt;br&gt; my heart is broken up into pieces&lt;br&gt; Cause i know i'll never free my soul&lt;br&gt; it's trapped in between true love and being alone&lt;br&gt; When my eyes are closed the greatest story told&lt;br&gt; I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor&lt;br&gt; Why oh why tell me why not me&lt;br&gt; Why oh why we're meant to be&lt;br&gt; Baby i know i could be all you need&lt;br&gt; Why oh why oh why&lt;br&gt; I wanna love you&lt;br&gt; if you only knew how much i love you&lt;br&gt; So why not me&lt;br&gt; The day after tomorrow I'll still be around&lt;br&gt; To catch you when you fall and never let you down&lt;br&gt; you say that were forever our love will never end&lt;br&gt; I've tried to come up but it's drowning me to know&lt;br&gt; you'll never feel my soul&lt;br&gt; It's trapped in between true love and being alone&lt;br&gt; when my eyes are closed the greatest story told&lt;br&gt; i woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor&lt;br&gt; Tell me baby why oh why tell me why not me&lt;br&gt; Why oh why we're meant to be&lt;br&gt; Baby i know i could be all you need&lt;br&gt; why oh why oh why&lt;br&gt; I wanna love you&lt;br&gt; if you only knew how much i love you&lt;br&gt; So why not me&lt;br&gt; You won't ever know&lt;br&gt; How far we can go&lt;br&gt; You won't ever know&lt;br&gt; How far we can go (go)&lt;br&gt; Why oh why tell me why not me&lt;br&gt; why oh why we're meant to be&lt;br&gt; Baby I know I could be all you need&lt;br&gt; Why oh why oh why&lt;br&gt; Why oh why tell me why not me&lt;br&gt; Why oh why we're meant to be&lt;br&gt; Baby I know I could be all you need&lt;br&gt; Why oh why oh why oh why&lt;br&gt; I wanna love you&lt;br&gt; If you only knew how much I love you&lt;br&gt; so why not me&lt;br&gt; (why not me, why not me)</Lyrics>

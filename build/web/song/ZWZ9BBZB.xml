    <Lyrics>&lt;br&gt; If only you could see the tears in the world you left behind&lt;br&gt; If only you could heal my heart just one more time&lt;br&gt; Even when I close my eyes&lt;br&gt; There's an image of your face&lt;br&gt; And once again I come I'll realise&lt;br&gt; You're a loss I can't replace&lt;br&gt; Soledad&lt;br&gt; It's a keeping for the lonely&lt;br&gt; Since the day that you were gone&lt;br&gt; Why did you leave me&lt;br&gt; Soledad&lt;br&gt; In my heart you were the only&lt;br&gt; And your memory live on &lt;br&gt; Why did you leave me&lt;br&gt; Soledad&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Walking down the streets of Nothingville&lt;br&gt; Where our love was young and free&lt;br&gt; Can't believe just what an empty place &lt;br&gt; It has come to be&lt;br&gt; I would give my life away&lt;br&gt; If it could only be the same&lt;br&gt; Cause I can't still the voice inside of me&lt;br&gt; That is calling out your name&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Soledad&lt;br&gt; It's a keeping for the lonely&lt;br&gt; Since the day that you were gone&lt;br&gt; Why did you leave me&lt;br&gt; Soledad&lt;br&gt; In my heart you were the only&lt;br&gt; And your memory live on &lt;br&gt; Why did you leave me&lt;br&gt; Soledad&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Time will never change the things you told me&lt;br&gt; After all we're meant to be love will bring us back to you and me&lt;br&gt; If only you could see&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Soledad&lt;br&gt; It's a keeping for the lonely&lt;br&gt; Since the day that you were gone&lt;br&gt; Why did you leave me&lt;br&gt; Soledad&lt;br&gt; In my heart you were the only&lt;br&gt; And your memory live on &lt;br&gt; Why did you leave me&lt;br&gt; Soledad &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

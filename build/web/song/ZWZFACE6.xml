    <Lyrics>When marimba rhythms start to play&lt;br&gt; Dance with me, make me sway&lt;br&gt; Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore&lt;br&gt; Hold me close, sway me more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Like a flower bending in the breeze&lt;br&gt; Bend with me, sway with ease&lt;br&gt; When we dance you have a way with me&lt;br&gt; Stay with me, sway with me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Other dancers may be on the floor&lt;br&gt; Dear, but my eyes will see only you&lt;br&gt; Only you have the magic technique&lt;br&gt; When we sway I go weak&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can hear the sounds of violins&lt;br&gt; Long before it begins&lt;br&gt; Make me thrill as only you know how&lt;br&gt; Sway me smooth, sway me now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Other dancers may be on the floor&lt;br&gt; Dear, but my eyes will see only you&lt;br&gt; Only you have the magic technique&lt;br&gt; When we sway I go weak&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can hear the sounds of violins&lt;br&gt; Long before it begins&lt;br&gt; Make me thrill as only you know how&lt;br&gt; Sway me smooth, sway me now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When marimba rhythms start to play&lt;br&gt; Dance with me, make me sway&lt;br&gt; Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore&lt;br&gt; Hold me close, sway me more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Like a flower bending in the breeze&lt;br&gt; Bend with me, sway with ease&lt;br&gt; When we dance you have a way with me&lt;br&gt; Stay with me, sway with me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When marimbas start to play&lt;br&gt; Hold me close, make me sway&lt;br&gt; Like an ocean hugs the shore&lt;br&gt; Hold me close, sway me more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Like a flower bending in the breeze&lt;br&gt; Bend with me, sway with ease&lt;br&gt; When we dance you have a way with me&lt;br&gt; Stay with me, sway with me</Lyrics>

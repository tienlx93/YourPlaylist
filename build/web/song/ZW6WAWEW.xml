    <Lyrics>Oh the weather outside is frightful &lt;br&gt; But the fire is so delightful &lt;br&gt; And since we've no place to go &lt;br&gt; Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! &lt;br&gt; It doesn't show signs of stopping &lt;br&gt; And I've bought some corn for popping &lt;br&gt; The lights are turned way down low &lt;br&gt; Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! &lt;br&gt; When we finally kiss goodnight &lt;br&gt; How I'll hate going out in the storm! &lt;br&gt; But if you'll really hold me tight &lt;br&gt; All the way home I'll be warm &lt;br&gt; The fire is slowly dying &lt;br&gt; And, my dear, we're still goodbying &lt;br&gt; But as long as you love me so &lt;br&gt; Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!</Lyrics>

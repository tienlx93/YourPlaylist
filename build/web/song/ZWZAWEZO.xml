    <Lyrics>Touch by touch, you're my all time lover&lt;br&gt; Skin to skin, come undone my cover&lt;br&gt; When I feel the time is right and your staying by my side&lt;br&gt; And the love you give to me makes my heart beat&lt;br&gt; When my fantasy fly away but my feelings make me stay&lt;br&gt; I see the fire in your eyes, it makes my heart beat&lt;br&gt; Do it, we'll still do it night and day&lt;br&gt; You're my all time lover&lt;br&gt; Do it, we'll still do it anyway&lt;br&gt; Like there is no other&lt;br&gt; Touch by touch, you're my all time lover&lt;br&gt; Skin to skin, come undone my cover&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When my heart full of love it makes me a turtle in dove&lt;br&gt; Love the game that we play night and day&lt;br&gt; When our love is clear and bright it's our way to see the light&lt;br&gt; There's a fire in our heart night and day&lt;br&gt; Do it, we'll still do it night and day&lt;br&gt; You're my all time lover&lt;br&gt; Do it, we'll still do it anyway&lt;br&gt; Like there is no other&lt;br&gt; Touch by touch, your my all time lover&lt;br&gt; Skin to skin, come undone my cover&lt;br&gt; Do it, we'll still do it night and day&lt;br&gt; You're my all time lover&lt;br&gt; Do it, we'll still do it anyway&lt;br&gt; Like there is no other&lt;br&gt; Touch by touch, you're my all time lover&lt;br&gt; Skin to skin, come undone my covers&lt;br&gt; Do it, we'll still do it night and day&lt;br&gt; You're my all time lover&lt;br&gt; Do it, we'll still do it anyway&lt;br&gt; Like there is no other&lt;br&gt; Touch by touch, your my all time lover&lt;br&gt; Skin to skin, come undone my covers</Lyrics>

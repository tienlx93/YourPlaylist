    <Lyrics>I try to find you at the bottom of the bottle&lt;br&gt; Lying down on the bathroom floor&lt;br&gt; My loneliness was wrangling windows&lt;br&gt; You say you don't want me anymore&lt;br&gt; And you left me&lt;br&gt; Standing on the corner crying&lt;br&gt; Feeling like a fool for trying&lt;br&gt; I don't even remember why&lt;br&gt; I’m wasting all these tears on you&lt;br&gt; I wish I could erase all memory&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you didn't give a damn about me&lt;br&gt; And finally I'm through&lt;br&gt; Wasting all these tears on you, these tears on you&lt;br&gt; You ain't worth another sleepless night&lt;br&gt; And I’ll do everything I got to do get you off my mind&lt;br&gt; 'Cause what you wanted I couldn’t give&lt;br&gt; What you did, boy I'll never forget&lt;br&gt; And you left me&lt;br&gt; Standing on the corner crying&lt;br&gt; Feeling like a fool for trying&lt;br&gt; I don't even remember why&lt;br&gt; I'm wasting all these tears on you&lt;br&gt; I wish I could erase all memory&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you didn't give a damn about me&lt;br&gt; And finally I'm through&lt;br&gt; Wasting all these tears on you, these tears on you&lt;br&gt; I try to find you at the bottom of the bottle&lt;br&gt; Lying down on the bathroom floor</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>♥...Safe and sound...♥&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I remember tears streaming down your face&lt;br&gt; When I said I'll never let you go&lt;br&gt; When all those shadows almost killed your light&lt;br&gt; I remember you said Don't leave me here alone&lt;br&gt; But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just close your eyes&lt;br&gt; The sun is going down&lt;br&gt; You'll be alright&lt;br&gt; No one can hurt you now&lt;br&gt; Come morning light&lt;br&gt; You and I'll be safe and sound&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Don't you dare look out your window darling&lt;br&gt; Everything's on fire&lt;br&gt; The war outside our door keeps raging on&lt;br&gt; Hold on to this lullaby&lt;br&gt; Even when the music's gone&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just close your eyes&lt;br&gt; The sun is going down&lt;br&gt; You'll be alright&lt;br&gt; No one can hurt you now&lt;br&gt; Come morning light&lt;br&gt; You and I'll be safe and sound&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just close your eyes&lt;br&gt; You'll be alright&lt;br&gt; Come morning light,&lt;br&gt; You and I'll be safe and sound.</Lyrics>

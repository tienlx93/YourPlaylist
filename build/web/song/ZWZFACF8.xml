    <Lyrics>When you're down and troubled&lt;br&gt; And you need some loving care&lt;br&gt; And nothing, nothing is going right&lt;br&gt; Close your eyes and think of me&lt;br&gt; And soon I will be there&lt;br&gt; To brighten up even your darkest night&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You just call out my name&lt;br&gt; And you know wherever I am&lt;br&gt; I'll come running to see you again&lt;br&gt; Winter, spring, summer or fall&lt;br&gt; All you have to do is call&lt;br&gt; And I'll be there&lt;br&gt; You've got a friend&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If the sky above you&lt;br&gt; Grows dark and full of clouds&lt;br&gt; And that old north wind begins to blow&lt;br&gt; Keep your head together&lt;br&gt; And call my name out loud&lt;br&gt; Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You just call out my name&lt;br&gt; And you know wherever I am&lt;br&gt; I'll come running to see you&lt;br&gt; Winter, spring, summer or fall&lt;br&gt; All you have to do is call&lt;br&gt; And I'll be there&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend&lt;br&gt; When people can be so cold&lt;br&gt; They'll hurt you, and desert you&lt;br&gt; And take your soul if you let them&lt;br&gt; Oh, but don't you let them&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You just call out my name&lt;br&gt; And you know wherever I am&lt;br&gt; I'll come running to see you again&lt;br&gt; Winter, spring, summer or fall&lt;br&gt; All you have to do is call&lt;br&gt; And I'll be there&lt;br&gt; You've got a friend</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&quot;Pompeii&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I was left to my own devices&lt;br&gt; Many days fell away with nothing to show&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And the walls kept tumbling down&lt;br&gt; In the city that we love&lt;br&gt; Great clouds roll over the hills&lt;br&gt; Bringing darkness from above&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But if you close your eyes,&lt;br&gt; Does it almost feel like&lt;br&gt; Nothing changed at all?&lt;br&gt; And if you close your eyes,&lt;br&gt; Does it almost feel like&lt;br&gt; You've been here before?&lt;br&gt; How am I gonna be an optimist about this?&lt;br&gt; How am I gonna be an optimist about this?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We were caught up and lost in all of our vices&lt;br&gt; In your pose as the dust settles around us&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And the walls kept tumbling down&lt;br&gt; In the city that we love&lt;br&gt; Great clouds roll over the hills&lt;br&gt; Bringing darkness from above&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But if you close your eyes,&lt;br&gt; Does it almost feel like&lt;br&gt; Nothing changed at all?&lt;br&gt; And if you close your eyes,&lt;br&gt; Does it almost feel like&lt;br&gt; You've been here before?&lt;br&gt; How am I gonna be an optimist about this?&lt;br&gt; How am I gonna be an optimist about this?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh where do we begin?&lt;br&gt; The rubble or our sins?&lt;br&gt; Oh where do we begin?&lt;br&gt; The rubble or our sins?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And the walls kept tumbling down&lt;br&gt; In the city that we love&lt;br&gt; Great clouds roll over the hills&lt;br&gt; Bringing darkness from above&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But if you close your eyes,&lt;br&gt; Does it almost feel like&lt;br&gt; Nothing changed at all?&lt;br&gt; And if you close your eyes,&lt;br&gt; Does it almost feel like&lt;br&gt; You've been here before?&lt;br&gt; How am I gonna be an optimist about this?&lt;br&gt; How am I gonna be an optimist about this?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Ever ever after (happily)...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Storybook endings, fairytales coming true&lt;br&gt; Deep down inside we want to believe they still do&lt;br&gt; In our secretest heart&lt;br&gt; It's our favorite part of the story&lt;br&gt; Let's just admit we all want to make it to ever ever after&lt;br&gt; If we just don't get in our own way&lt;br&gt; Ever ever after&lt;br&gt; It may only be a wish away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Start a new fashion - wear your heart on your sleeve&lt;br&gt; Somethings you reach what's realest by making believe&lt;br&gt; Unafraid, unashamed&lt;br&gt; There is joy to be claimed in this world&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You even might wind up being glad to be you&lt;br&gt; Ever ever after&lt;br&gt; Though the world will tell you it's not smart&lt;br&gt; Ever ever after&lt;br&gt; The world can be yours if you let your heart believe in ever after&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And no wonder your heart feels it's flying&lt;br&gt; Your head feels it's spinning&lt;br&gt; Each happy ending's a brand new beginning&lt;br&gt; Let yourself be enchanted you just might break through to ever ever after&lt;br&gt; Forever could even start today&lt;br&gt; Ever ever after&lt;br&gt; Maybe it's just one wish away&lt;br&gt; Your ever ever after&lt;br&gt; (I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss)&lt;br&gt; Forever ever after</Lyrics>

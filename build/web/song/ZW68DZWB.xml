    <Lyrics>Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Can’t hold you back anymore&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Turn my back and slam the door&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The snow blows white on the mountain tonight&lt;br&gt; Not a footprint to be seen&lt;br&gt; A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I’m the queen&lt;br&gt; The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside&lt;br&gt; Couldn’t keep it in&lt;br&gt; Heaven knows I try&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Don’t let them in, don’t let them see&lt;br&gt; Be the good girl you always had to be&lt;br&gt; Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know&lt;br&gt; Well now they know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Can’t hold you back anymore&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go,&lt;br&gt; Turn my back and slam the door&lt;br&gt; And here I stand&lt;br&gt; And here I’ll stay&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; The cold never bothered me anyway&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It’s funny how some distance makes everything seem small&lt;br&gt; And the fears that once controlled me can’t get to me at all&lt;br&gt; Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe&lt;br&gt; I know left a life behind but I’m to relieved to grieve&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Can’t hold you back anymore&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go,&lt;br&gt; Turn my back and slam the door&lt;br&gt; And here I stand&lt;br&gt; And here I’ll stay&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; The cold never bothered me anyway&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Standing frozen in the life I’ve chosen&lt;br&gt; You won’t find me, the past is so behind me&lt;br&gt; Buried in the snow&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; Can’t hold you back anymore&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go,&lt;br&gt; Turn my back and slam the door&lt;br&gt; And here I stand&lt;br&gt; And here I’ll stay&lt;br&gt; Let it go, let it go&lt;br&gt; The cold never bothered me anyway</Lyrics>

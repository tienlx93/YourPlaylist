    <Lyrics>&quot;I'm Not The Only One&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You and me, we made a vow&lt;br&gt; For better or for worse&lt;br&gt; I can't believe you let me down&lt;br&gt; But the proof's in the way it hurts&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; For months on end I've had my doubts&lt;br&gt; Denying every tear&lt;br&gt; I wish this would be over now&lt;br&gt; But I know that I still need you here&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; You say I'm crazy&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done&lt;br&gt; But when you call me baby&lt;br&gt; I know I'm not the only one&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You've been so unavailable&lt;br&gt; Now sadly I know why&lt;br&gt; Your heart is unobtainable&lt;br&gt; Even though Lord knows you kept mine&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; You say I'm crazy&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done&lt;br&gt; But when you call me baby&lt;br&gt; I know I'm not the only one&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I have loved you for many years&lt;br&gt; Maybe I am just not enough&lt;br&gt; You've made me realize my deepest fear&lt;br&gt; By lying and tearing us up&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus 2x:]&lt;br&gt; You say I'm crazy&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done&lt;br&gt; But when you call me baby&lt;br&gt; I know I'm not the only one&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I know I'm not the only one&lt;br&gt; I know I'm not the only one&lt;br&gt; And I know...&lt;br&gt; I know I'm not the only one&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

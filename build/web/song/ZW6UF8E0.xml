    <Lyrics>[Verse 1]&lt;br&gt; Aren't you somethin' to admire&lt;br&gt; Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror&lt;br&gt; And I can't help but notice&lt;br&gt; You reflect in this heart of mine&lt;br&gt; If you ever feel alone and&lt;br&gt; The glare makes me hard to find&lt;br&gt; Just know that I'm always&lt;br&gt; Peering out on the other side&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Pre-Hook]&lt;br&gt; Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soap&lt;br&gt; I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go&lt;br&gt; Just put your hand on the past&lt;br&gt; I'm here tryin' to pull you through&lt;br&gt; You just gotta be strong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook 1]&lt;br&gt; Cause I don't wanna lose you now&lt;br&gt; I'm lookin' right at the other half of me&lt;br&gt; The biggest scene is set in my heart&lt;br&gt; There's a space, but now you're home&lt;br&gt; Show me how to fight for now&lt;br&gt; And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy&lt;br&gt; Comin' back into you once I figured it out&lt;br&gt; You were right here all along&lt;br&gt; It's like you're my mirror&lt;br&gt; My mirror staring back at me&lt;br&gt; I couldn't get any bigger&lt;br&gt; With anyone else beside me&lt;br&gt; And now it's clear as this promise&lt;br&gt; That we're making&lt;br&gt; Two reflections into one&lt;br&gt; Cause it's like you're my mirror&lt;br&gt; My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2]&lt;br&gt; Aren't you somethin', an original&lt;br&gt; Cause it doesn't seem really as simple&lt;br&gt; And I can't help but stare, cause&lt;br&gt; I see truth somewhere in your eyes&lt;br&gt; I can't ever change without you&lt;br&gt; You reflect me, I love that about you&lt;br&gt; And if I could, I&lt;br&gt; Would look at us all the time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Pre-Hook]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Break]&lt;br&gt; Yesterday is history&lt;br&gt; Tomorrow's a mystery&lt;br&gt; I can see you lookin' back at me&lt;br&gt; Keep your eyes on me&lt;br&gt; Baby, keep your eyes on me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook 2] x10&lt;br&gt; You are you are the love of my life&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 3]&lt;br&gt; Baby, you're the inspiration for this precious song&lt;br&gt; And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on&lt;br&gt; So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone&lt;br&gt; And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home&lt;br&gt; Just to let you know, you are&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook 2] x8&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 4]&lt;br&gt; Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you&lt;br&gt; My reflection, in everything I do&lt;br&gt; You're my reflection and all I see is you&lt;br&gt; My reflection, in everything I do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook 2] x16</Lyrics>

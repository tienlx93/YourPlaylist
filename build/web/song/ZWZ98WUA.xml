    <Lyrics>We're not gonna be just a part of their game&lt;br&gt; We're not gonna be just the victims&lt;br&gt; They're taking our dreams and they tear them apart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 'Till everyone's the same&lt;br&gt; I've got no place to go&lt;br&gt; I've got nowhere to run.&lt;br&gt; They love to watch me fall&lt;br&gt; They think they know it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm a nightmare, a disaster&lt;br&gt; That's what they always said&lt;br&gt; I'm a lost cause, not a hero&lt;br&gt; But I'll make it on my own&lt;br&gt; I've gotta prove them wrong&lt;br&gt; Me against the world&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's me against the world&lt;br&gt; We won't let them change how we feel in our hearts&lt;br&gt; We're not gonna let them control us&lt;br&gt; We won't let them shove all their thoughts in our heads&lt;br&gt; And we'll never be like them&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've got no place to go&lt;br&gt; I've got nowhere to run&lt;br&gt; They love to watch me fall&lt;br&gt; They think they know it all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm a nightmare, a disaster&lt;br&gt; That's what they always said&lt;br&gt; I'm a lost cause, not a hero&lt;br&gt; But I'll make it on my own&lt;br&gt; I've gotta prove them wrong&lt;br&gt; It's me against the world&lt;br&gt; World….world…world…&lt;br&gt; Me against the world&lt;br&gt; World….world…world…&lt;br&gt; (scream)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now I'm sick of this waiting&lt;br&gt; So come on and take your shot&lt;br&gt; You can spit out your insults&lt;br&gt; But nothing you say is gonna change us&lt;br&gt; You can sit there and judge me&lt;br&gt; Say what you want to&lt;br&gt; We'll never let you win.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm a nightmare, a disaster&lt;br&gt; That's what they always said&lt;br&gt; I'm a lost cause, not a hero&lt;br&gt; But I'll make it on my own&lt;br&gt; Me against the world&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm a nightmare, a disaster&lt;br&gt; That's what they always said&lt;br&gt; I'm a lost cause, not a hero&lt;br&gt; But I'll make it on my own&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm gonna prove them wrong&lt;br&gt; They'll never bring us down&lt;br&gt; We'll never fall in line&lt;br&gt; I'll make it on my own&lt;br&gt; Me against the world&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

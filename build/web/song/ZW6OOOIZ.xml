    <Lyrics>&quot;Better Dig Two&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I told you on the day we wed&lt;br&gt; I was gonna love you 'til I's dead&lt;br&gt; Made you wait 'til our wedding night&lt;br&gt; That's the first and the last time I wear white&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So if the ties that bind ever do come loose&lt;br&gt; Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose&lt;br&gt; Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell&lt;br&gt; Before I'll see you with someone else&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Put me in the ground&lt;br&gt; Put me six foot down&lt;br&gt; And let the stone say:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Here lies the girl whose only crutch&lt;br&gt; Was loving one man just a little too much&lt;br&gt; If you go before I do&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well,&lt;br&gt; It won't be whiskey, won't be meth&lt;br&gt; It'll be your name on my last breath&lt;br&gt; If divorce or death ever do us part&lt;br&gt; The coroner will call it a broken heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So put me in the ground&lt;br&gt; Put me six foot down&lt;br&gt; And let the stone say:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Here lies the girl whose only crutch&lt;br&gt; Was loving one man just a little too much&lt;br&gt; If you go before I do&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Dig two&lt;br&gt; Ooh, ooh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I took your name when I took those vows&lt;br&gt; I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now,&lt;br&gt; Oh, right now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If the ties that bind ever do come loose&lt;br&gt; If forever ever ends for you&lt;br&gt; If that ring gets a little too tight&lt;br&gt; You might as well read me my last rights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And let the stone say:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Here lies the girl whose only crutch&lt;br&gt; Was loving one man just a little too much&lt;br&gt; If you go before I do&lt;br&gt; Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Heavy stone right next to mine,&lt;br&gt; We'll be together 'til the end of time&lt;br&gt; Don't you go before I do,&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I told you on the day we wed&lt;br&gt; I was gonna love you 'til I's dead</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Isn't it funny&lt;br&gt; How times seems to slip away&lt;br&gt; So fast&lt;br&gt; One minute you're happy&lt;br&gt; The other you're sad&lt;br&gt; But if you give me one more chance&lt;br&gt; To show my love for you is true&lt;br&gt; I'll stand by your side&lt;br&gt; Your whole life through&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If life is so short&lt;br&gt; Why won't you let me love you&lt;br&gt; Before we run out of time&lt;br&gt; If love is so strong&lt;br&gt; Why won't you take the chance&lt;br&gt; Before our time has come&lt;br&gt; If life is so short&lt;br&gt; If life is so short&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Love is a word that explains&lt;br&gt; How I feel for you&lt;br&gt; And when you're in my arms&lt;br&gt; All my dreams come true&lt;br&gt; And when you're not around&lt;br&gt; You can't hardly see&lt;br&gt; These tears that I'm crying&lt;br&gt; Now are for you to be with me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If life is short&lt;br&gt; Why won't you let me love you&lt;br&gt; Before we run out of time&lt;br&gt; If love is so strong&lt;br&gt; Why won't you take the chance&lt;br&gt; Before our time has gone&lt;br&gt; If life is so short&lt;br&gt; If life is so short&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

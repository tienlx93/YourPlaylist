    <Lyrics>I know I'm still young&lt;br&gt; But, I know how I feel&lt;br&gt; I might not have too much experience&lt;br&gt; But, I know when love is real.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; By the way my heart starts pounding&lt;br&gt; When I look into your eyes&lt;br&gt; I might look a little silly&lt;br&gt; Standing with my arms stretched open wide.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I love you this big&lt;br&gt; Eyes have never seen... this big&lt;br&gt; No-one's ever dreamed... this big&lt;br&gt; And I'll spend the rest of my life&lt;br&gt; Explaining what words cannot describe but, I'll try&lt;br&gt; I love you this big&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll love you to the moon and back&lt;br&gt; I'll love you all the time&lt;br&gt; Deeper than the ocean&lt;br&gt; And higher than the pines.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause girl, you do something to me&lt;br&gt; Deep down in my heart&lt;br&gt; I know I look a little crazy&lt;br&gt; Standing with my arms stretched all apart.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I love you this big&lt;br&gt; Eyes have never seen... this big&lt;br&gt; No-one's ever dreamed... this big&lt;br&gt; And I'll spend the rest of my life&lt;br&gt; Explaining what words cannot describe but, I'll try&lt;br&gt; I love you this big&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So much bigger than I ever dreamed my heart ever would&lt;br&gt; I love you this big&lt;br&gt; And I'd write your name in stars across the sky&lt;br&gt; If I could, I would&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I love you this big&lt;br&gt; Oh, eyes have never seen... this big&lt;br&gt; No-one's ever dreamed... this big&lt;br&gt; And I'll spend the rest of my life&lt;br&gt; Explaining what words cannot describe but, I'll try&lt;br&gt; I love you this big&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I love you this big&lt;br&gt; Oh, eyes have never seen... this big&lt;br&gt; No-one's ever dreamed... this big&lt;br&gt; And I'll spend the rest of my life&lt;br&gt; Explaining what words cannot describe but, I'll try&lt;br&gt; I love you this big</Lyrics>

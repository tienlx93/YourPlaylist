    <Lyrics>Would you know my name?&lt;br&gt; if I saw you in Heaven&lt;br&gt; Would it be the same&lt;br&gt; if I saw you in Heaven&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I must be strong and carry on&lt;br&gt; Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Would you hold my hand,&lt;br&gt; if I saw you in heaven&lt;br&gt; Would you help me stand,&lt;br&gt; if I saw you in heaven&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll find my way through night and day&lt;br&gt; Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Time can bring you down&lt;br&gt; Time can bend your knees&lt;br&gt; Time can break your heart&lt;br&gt; Have you beggin&lt;br&gt; please beggin please&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Beyond the door, there's peace for sure&lt;br&gt; and I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.&lt;br&gt; Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven</Lyrics>

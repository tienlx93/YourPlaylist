    <Lyrics>&quot;Impossible&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Spoke up and thought I'd try&lt;br&gt; Try to step across the line&lt;br&gt; You know that I've been thinkin' 'bout it for a while&lt;br&gt; Yeah starting to think it's time I knee&lt;br&gt; Does me good to know I finally feel&lt;br&gt; Feel this pain, it's real&lt;br&gt; It's possible&lt;br&gt; You say&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Can't change the winds, you say&lt;br&gt; Won't matter anyway&lt;br&gt; Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible&lt;br&gt; It's impossible&lt;br&gt; Can't rise above this place&lt;br&gt; Won't change your mind so I pray&lt;br&gt; Breakin' down the walls&lt;br&gt; Do the impossible&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Walkin' by myself I know&lt;br&gt; This lonely road's becomin' my new home&lt;br&gt; But I don't stop, I just keep movin' on&lt;br&gt; And on&lt;br&gt; Ain't no need to dry my eyes&lt;br&gt; I haven't cried in quite some time&lt;br&gt; Every day I fight it&lt;br&gt; You know it's possible&lt;br&gt; You say&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Can someone tell me why it's so hard takin' chances&lt;br&gt; You draw the line and think that I won't ask for more, yeah&lt;br&gt; I will stumble and I'll make my own mistakes yeah&lt;br&gt; But I won't worry 'bout it anymore&lt;br&gt; It's impossible&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's impossible to you&lt;br&gt; Not impossible for me&lt;br&gt; Not impossible for me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Spoke up and though it'd try&lt;br&gt; Try to step across the line</Lyrics>

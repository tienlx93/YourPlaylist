    <Lyrics>Tonight I Wanna Cry - Keith Urban&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Alone in this house again tonight&lt;br&gt; I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine&lt;br&gt; There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me&lt;br&gt; The way that it was and could have been surrounds me&lt;br&gt; I'll never get over you walkin' away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (Chorus:)&lt;br&gt; I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show&lt;br&gt; And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control&lt;br&gt; But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain&lt;br&gt; To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain&lt;br&gt; From my eyes&lt;br&gt; Tonight I wanna cry&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Would it help if I turned a sad song on&lt;br&gt; &quot;All By Myself&quot; would sure hit me hard now that you're gone&lt;br&gt; Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters&lt;br&gt; It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better&lt;br&gt; But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show&lt;br&gt; And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control&lt;br&gt; But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain&lt;br&gt; To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain&lt;br&gt; From my eyes&lt;br&gt; Tonight I wanna cry&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show&lt;br&gt; And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your self-control&lt;br&gt; But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain&lt;br&gt; To hell with this pride, let it fall like rain&lt;br&gt; From my eyes&lt;br&gt; Tonight I wanna cry</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>The other night dear, as I lay sleeping &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I dreamed I held you in my arms &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I hung my head and I cried. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are my sunshine, my only sunshine&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You make me happy when skies are grey &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You'll never know dear, how much I love you &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Please don't take my sunshine away &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll always love you and make you happy, &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you will only say the same. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But if you leave me to love another, &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You'll regret it all some day: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are my sunshine, my only sunshine&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You make me happy when skies are grey &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You'll never know dear, how much I love you &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Please don't take my sunshine away &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You told me once, dear, you really loved me &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And no one else could come between. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But now you've left me and love another; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You have shattered all my dreams: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are my sunshine, my only sunshine&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You make me happy when skies are grey &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You'll never know dear, how much I love you &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Please don't take my sunshine away&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

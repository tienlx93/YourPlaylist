    <Lyrics>&lt;br&gt; &quot;Pray To God&quot;&lt;br&gt; (feat. Haim)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, I remember when this road was my own&lt;br&gt; I pray to god, I just don't know anymore&lt;br&gt; I pray to god, I just don't know anymore&lt;br&gt; Anymore&lt;br&gt; I lost the feeling but I try to hold on&lt;br&gt; I thought the end of a love and what made you strong&lt;br&gt; I pray to god, I just don't know anymore&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When there's no getting through&lt;br&gt; I won't hold back&lt;br&gt; I will throw down anything in life, I know now&lt;br&gt; I've been lyin' on the floor&lt;br&gt; Sleeping on the ground&lt;br&gt; I will give up everything in life, I know how&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause I can't stop wondering&lt;br&gt; If I was too late to see the signs&lt;br&gt; If I could go back with hands up&lt;br&gt; I'd look up to the sky&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give into you&lt;br&gt; Give into you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'&lt;br&gt; I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'&lt;br&gt; Shinin' bright to come and bring me back home&lt;br&gt; The lights in my eyes, they disappeared&lt;br&gt; The visions in my mind are enough to keep me from fear&lt;br&gt; I won't let it hold me down&lt;br&gt; The other way around&lt;br&gt; I don't want the words to, I can't make a sound&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause I can't stop wondering&lt;br&gt; If I was too late to see the signs&lt;br&gt; If I could go back with hands up&lt;br&gt; I'd look up to the sky&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give into you&lt;br&gt; Give into you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Can't hold back&lt;br&gt; Reachin' out&lt;br&gt; (Hot, hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment&lt;br&gt; Between us&lt;br&gt; I told you that&lt;br&gt; (Hot, hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; (Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; (Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; (Hot, hot) I was livin' in the heat in the moment&lt;br&gt; I'd give into to you&lt;br&gt; Give into you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give into you&lt;br&gt; Give into you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give in&lt;br&gt; I'd give into you&lt;br&gt; Give into you&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

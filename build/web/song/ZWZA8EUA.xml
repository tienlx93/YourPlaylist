    <Lyrics>[Verse]&lt;br&gt; I wake up with blood-shot eyes&lt;br&gt; Struggled to memorize&lt;br&gt; The way it felt between your thighs&lt;br&gt; Pleasure that made you cry&lt;br&gt; Feels so good to be bad&lt;br&gt; Not worth the aftermath, after that&lt;br&gt; After that&lt;br&gt; Try to get you back&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge]&lt;br&gt; I still don't have the reason&lt;br&gt; And you don't have the time&lt;br&gt; And it really makes me wonder&lt;br&gt; If I ever gave a fuck about you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Give me something to believe in&lt;br&gt; Cause I don't believe in you anymore&lt;br&gt; Anymore&lt;br&gt; I wonder if it even makes a difference to try&lt;br&gt; (Yeah)&lt;br&gt; So this is goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse]&lt;br&gt; God damn my spinning head&lt;br&gt; Decisions that made my bed&lt;br&gt; Now I must lay in it&lt;br&gt; And deal with things I've left unsaid&lt;br&gt; I want to dive into you&lt;br&gt; Forget what you're going through&lt;br&gt; I get behind, make your move&lt;br&gt; Forget about the truth&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge]&lt;br&gt; I still don't have the reason&lt;br&gt; And you don't have the time&lt;br&gt; And it really makes me wonder&lt;br&gt; If I ever gave a fuck about you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Give me something to believe in&lt;br&gt; Cause I don't believe in you anymore&lt;br&gt; Anymore&lt;br&gt; I wonder if it even makes a difference,&lt;br&gt; It even makes a difference to try&lt;br&gt; And you told me how you're feeling&lt;br&gt; But I don't believe it's true anymore&lt;br&gt; Anymore&lt;br&gt; I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry&lt;br&gt; (Oh no)&lt;br&gt; So this is goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Breakdown]&lt;br&gt; I've been here before&lt;br&gt; One day I'll wake up&lt;br&gt; And it won't hurt anymore&lt;br&gt; You caught me in a lie&lt;br&gt; I have no alibi&lt;br&gt; The words you say don't have a meaning&lt;br&gt; Cause&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge]&lt;br&gt; I still don't have the reason&lt;br&gt; And you don't have the time&lt;br&gt; And it really makes me wonder&lt;br&gt; If I ever gave a fuck about you&lt;br&gt; And I...and so this is goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Give me something to believe in&lt;br&gt; Cause I don't believe in you anymore&lt;br&gt; Anymore&lt;br&gt; I wonder if it even makes a difference,&lt;br&gt; It even makes a difference to try&lt;br&gt; And you told me how you're feeling&lt;br&gt; But I don't believe it's true anymore&lt;br&gt; Anymore&lt;br&gt; I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry&lt;br&gt; (Oh no)&lt;br&gt; So this is goodbye&lt;br&gt; So this is goodbye, yeah [x3]&lt;br&gt; (Oh no)</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I guess that this is where we've come to &lt;br&gt; If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me &lt;br&gt; But I, wont be there when you go down &lt;br&gt; Just so you know now &lt;br&gt; You're on your own now, believe me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ryu:&lt;br&gt; Yo, I don't wanna be the one to blame&lt;br&gt; You like fun and games, keep playin' 'em&lt;br&gt; I'm just sayin'&lt;br&gt; Think back then we was like one and the same&lt;br&gt; On the right track, but I was on the wrong train&lt;br&gt; It's like that, now you gotta face the pain&lt;br&gt; And the devil's got a fresh new place to play&lt;br&gt; In your brain like a maze you can never escape&lt;br&gt; The rain, every damn day's the same shade of grey&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Mike:&lt;br&gt; Hey, I used to have a little bit of a plan&lt;br&gt; Used to, have a concept of where I stand&lt;br&gt; But that concept slipped right outta my hand&lt;br&gt; Now, I dont really even know who I am&lt;br&gt; Yo, what do I have to say? Maybe&lt;br&gt; I should do what I have to do to break free, and&lt;br&gt; Whatever happens to you, we'll see&lt;br&gt; But its not gonna happen with me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I guess that this is where we've come to &lt;br&gt; If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me &lt;br&gt; But I, wont be there when you go down &lt;br&gt; Just so you know now &lt;br&gt; You're on your own now, believe me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Mike:&lt;br&gt; Back then, I thought you were just like me&lt;br&gt; Somebody who could see all the pain I see&lt;br&gt; But you proved to me unintentionally&lt;br&gt; That you would self destruct eventually&lt;br&gt; Now i'm thinkin' like the mistake that I made doesn't hurt&lt;br&gt; But it's not gonna work cause its &lt;br&gt; Really much worse than I thought&lt;br&gt; I wished you were something you were not &lt;br&gt; And now this guilt is really all that I've got&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Tak:&lt;br&gt; You turned your back and walk away ashamed&lt;br&gt; All you got&lt;br&gt; Is a memory and pain, nothing makes sense&lt;br&gt; You stare at the ground, and hear my voice inside your head &lt;br&gt; When no one else is around&lt;br&gt; What do i have to say&lt;br&gt; Maybe i should do what i have to do to break free, yeah&lt;br&gt; Whatever happens to you, we'll see&lt;br&gt; But it's not gonna happen to me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I guess that this is where we've come to &lt;br&gt; If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me &lt;br&gt; But I, wont be there when you go down &lt;br&gt; Just so you know now &lt;br&gt; You're on your own now, believe me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (Yeah. Lets go)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm guess that this is where we've come to&lt;br&gt; (Yeah)&lt;br&gt; If you don't want to, then you don't have to believe me &lt;br&gt; But I, wont be there when you go down &lt;br&gt; (Yeah)&lt;br&gt; Just so you know now&lt;br&gt; You're on your own now, believe me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm doing what I have to do&lt;br&gt; You're on your own now believe me&lt;br&gt; Whatever happens to you&lt;br&gt; You're on your own now believe me&lt;br&gt; What do I have to say?&lt;br&gt; You're on your own now believe me&lt;br&gt; Its not gonna happen to me&lt;br&gt; You're on your own now believe me</Lyrics>

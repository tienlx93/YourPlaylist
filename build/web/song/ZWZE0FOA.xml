    <Lyrics>Heart beats fast&lt;br&gt; Colors and promises&lt;br&gt; How to be brave&lt;br&gt; How can I love when I'm afraid to fall&lt;br&gt; But watching you stand alone&lt;br&gt; All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow&lt;br&gt; One step closer&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I have died everyday waiting for you&lt;br&gt; Darling don't be afraid I have loved you&lt;br&gt; For a thousand years&lt;br&gt; I'll love you for a thousand more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Time stands still&lt;br&gt; Beauty in all she is&lt;br&gt; I will be brave&lt;br&gt; I will not let anything take away&lt;br&gt; What's standing in front of me&lt;br&gt; Every breath&lt;br&gt; Every hour has come to this&lt;br&gt; One step closer&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I have died everyday waiting for you&lt;br&gt; Darling don't be afraid I have loved you&lt;br&gt; For a thousand years&lt;br&gt; I'll love you for a thousand more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And all along I believed I would find you&lt;br&gt; Time has brought your heart to me&lt;br&gt; I have loved you for a thousand years&lt;br&gt; I'll love you for a thousand more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One step closer&lt;br&gt; One step closer&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I have died everyday waiting for you&lt;br&gt; Darling don't be afraid I have loved you&lt;br&gt; For a thousand years&lt;br&gt; I'll love you for a thousand more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And all along I believed I would find you&lt;br&gt; Time has brought your heart to me&lt;br&gt; I have loved you for a thousand years&lt;br&gt; I'll love you for a thousand more &lt;br&gt; ~~~Miki Haruko~~~</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate &lt;br&gt; Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate &lt;br&gt; I was lookin' for her boyfriend &lt;br&gt; Thinkin', no way she ain't got one &lt;br&gt; Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love &lt;br&gt; Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup &lt;br&gt; Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck &lt;br&gt; She jumped up and cut me off &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; She was like, oh my God, this is my song &lt;br&gt; I've been listenin' to the radio all night long &lt;br&gt; Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is &lt;br&gt; She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance &lt;br&gt; 'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand &lt;br&gt; Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out &lt;br&gt; And she gave me a kiss &lt;br&gt; And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again &lt;br&gt; And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'd have gave that DJ my last dime &lt;br&gt; If he would have played it just one more time &lt;br&gt; But a little while later &lt;br&gt; We were sittin' in the drive in my truck &lt;br&gt; Before I walked her to the door &lt;br&gt; I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too &lt;br&gt; But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove &lt;br&gt; Man, you should have seen her light up &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; She was like, oh my God, this is my song &lt;br&gt; We've been listenin' to the radio all night long &lt;br&gt; I can't believe it came back on, but here it is &lt;br&gt; She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance &lt;br&gt; 'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand &lt;br&gt; Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss &lt;br&gt; And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again &lt;br&gt; And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars &lt;br&gt; You should have seen her smile when I brought out my guitar &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; She was like, oh my God, this is my song &lt;br&gt; I've been listenin' to the radio all night long &lt;br&gt; Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is &lt;br&gt; She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance &lt;br&gt; 'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand &lt;br&gt; Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out &lt;br&gt; And she gave me a kiss &lt;br&gt; And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again &lt;br&gt; And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again &lt;br&gt; Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again</Lyrics>

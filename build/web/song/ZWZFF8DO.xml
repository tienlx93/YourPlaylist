    <Lyrics>I'm lying alone with my head on the phone&lt;br&gt; Thinking of you till it hurts&lt;br&gt; I know you hurt too but what else can we do&lt;br&gt; Tormented and torn apart&lt;br&gt; I wish I could carry your smile and my heart&lt;br&gt; For times when my life feels so low&lt;br&gt; It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring&lt;br&gt; When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you&lt;br&gt; I know you were right believing for so long&lt;br&gt; I'm all out of love, what am I without you&lt;br&gt; I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I want you to come back and carry me home&lt;br&gt; Away from this long lonely nights&lt;br&gt; I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too&lt;br&gt; Does the feeling seem oh so right&lt;br&gt; And what would you say if I called on you now&lt;br&gt; And said that I can't hold on&lt;br&gt; There's no easy way, it gets harder each day&lt;br&gt; Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, what are you thinking of?&lt;br&gt; What are you thinking of?&lt;br&gt; Oh, what are you thinking of?&lt;br&gt; What are you thinking of?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus x3]</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&quot;Lighters&quot;&lt;br&gt; (feat. Bruno Mars)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bruno Mars]&lt;br&gt; This one’s for you and me, living out our dreams&lt;br&gt; We’re all right where we should be&lt;br&gt; Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes&lt;br&gt; And now all I wanna see&lt;br&gt; Is a sky full of lighters&lt;br&gt; A sky full of lighters&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Eminem]&lt;br&gt; By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up&lt;br&gt; I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up&lt;br&gt; If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,&lt;br&gt; Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em’ skyward uh&lt;br&gt; Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king…&lt;br&gt; This rap game’s nipple is mine for the milking,&lt;br&gt; Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till’ it kills me&lt;br&gt; I swear to god I’ll be the fucking illest in this music&lt;br&gt; There is or there ever will be, disagree?&lt;br&gt; Feel free, but from now on I’m refusing to ever give up&lt;br&gt; The only thing I ever gave up’s using no more excuses&lt;br&gt; Excuse me if my head is too big for this building&lt;br&gt; And pardon me if I’m a cocky prick but you cocks are slick&lt;br&gt; Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit&lt;br&gt; Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite&lt;br&gt; You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks&lt;br&gt; I love it when I tell em shove it&lt;br&gt; Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked,Flustered&lt;br&gt; Cuz he couldn’t cut mustard, muster up nothing&lt;br&gt; Brain fuzzy, cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzz&lt;br&gt; Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it&lt;br&gt; Wasn’t cause he had buzzards circle around his head&lt;br&gt; Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?&lt;br&gt; Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off&lt;br&gt; Little hussy ass, cause fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it&lt;br&gt; What difference it make?&lt;br&gt; What it take to get it through your thick skulls&lt;br&gt; That this ain't some bullshit&lt;br&gt; People don’t usually come back this way&lt;br&gt; From a place that was dark as I was in&lt;br&gt; Just to get to this place&lt;br&gt; Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage&lt;br&gt; And let it be known from this day forward&lt;br&gt; I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength&lt;br&gt; So let em bic’s raise cause I came with 5’9′ but I feel like I’m 6’8″&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bruno Mars]&lt;br&gt; This one’s for you and me, living out our dreams&lt;br&gt; We’re all right where we should be&lt;br&gt; Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes&lt;br&gt; And now all I wanna see&lt;br&gt; Is a sky full of lighters&lt;br&gt; A sky full of lighters&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Royce Da 5'9&quot;]&lt;br&gt; By the time you hear this I’ll probably already be outtie&lt;br&gt; I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi&lt;br&gt; My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin to blow it&lt;br&gt; And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute&lt;br&gt; To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic&lt;br&gt; Tell him how real he is or how high I am&lt;br&gt; Or how I would kill for him for him to know it&lt;br&gt; I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back&lt;br&gt; So it’s only right that I write till he can march right into that post office and tell em to hang it up&lt;br&gt; Now his career’s Lebron’s jersey in 20 years&lt;br&gt; I’ll stop when I’m at the very top&lt;br&gt; You shitted on me on your way up&lt;br&gt; It’s ’bout to be a scary drop&lt;br&gt; Cause what goes up must come down&lt;br&gt; You going down on something you don’t wanna see like a hairy box&lt;br&gt; Every hour, happy hour now&lt;br&gt; Life is wacky now&lt;br&gt; Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy&lt;br&gt; Now I’m just the cats meooww, ow&lt;br&gt; Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao&lt;br&gt; Ya’ll are doomed&lt;br&gt; I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me&lt;br&gt; My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes&lt;br&gt; Cause now I’m in the Aston&lt;br&gt; I went from having my city locked up&lt;br&gt; To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick&lt;br&gt; And now I’m fantastic&lt;br&gt; Compared to a weed high&lt;br&gt; And y’all niggas just gossipin’ like bitches on a radio and TV&lt;br&gt; See me, we fly&lt;br&gt; Y’all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive&lt;br&gt; And how real is that&lt;br&gt; I remember signing my first deal and now I’m the second best I can deal with that&lt;br&gt; Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bruno Mars]&lt;br&gt; You and I know what it’s like to be kicked down&lt;br&gt; Forced to fight&lt;br&gt; But tonight we’re alright&lt;br&gt; So hold up your light&lt;br&gt; Let it shine&lt;br&gt; Cause this one’s for you and me, living out our dreams&lt;br&gt; We’re all right where we should be&lt;br&gt; Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes&lt;br&gt; And now all I wanna see&lt;br&gt; Is a sky full of lighters&lt;br&gt; A sky full of lighters &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Put on your war paint&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down&lt;br&gt; Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground&lt;br&gt; We are the jack-o-lanterns in July&lt;br&gt; Setting fire to the sky&lt;br&gt; Here, here comes this rising tide&lt;br&gt; So come on&lt;br&gt; Put on your war paint&lt;br&gt; Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies&lt;br&gt; Silver clouds with grey linings&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked&lt;br&gt; One maniac at a time we will take it back&lt;br&gt; You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start&lt;br&gt; So dance along to the beat of your heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hey young blood&lt;br&gt; Doesn't it feel&lt;br&gt; Like our time is running out&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna change you like a remix&lt;br&gt; Then I'll raise you like a phoenix&lt;br&gt; You're wearing our vintage misery&lt;br&gt; No, I think it looked a little better on me&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna change you like a remix&lt;br&gt; Then I'll raise you like a phoenix&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks&lt;br&gt; Get hitched and make a career out of robbing banks&lt;br&gt; Because the world is just a teller and&lt;br&gt; We are wearing black masks&lt;br&gt; &quot;You broke our spirit,&quot; says the note we pass&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked&lt;br&gt; One maniac at a time we will take it back&lt;br&gt; You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start&lt;br&gt; So dance along to the beat of your heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hey young blood&lt;br&gt; Doesn't it feel&lt;br&gt; Like our time is running out&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna change you like a remix&lt;br&gt; Then I'll raise you like a phoenix&lt;br&gt; You're wearing our vintage misery&lt;br&gt; No, I think it looked a little better on me&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna change you like a remix&lt;br&gt; Then I'll raise you like a phoenix&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Put on your war paint&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The war is won&lt;br&gt; Before it's begun&lt;br&gt; Release the doves&lt;br&gt; Surrender love&lt;br&gt; [x4]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (Wave the white flag!)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hey young blood&lt;br&gt; Doesn't it feel&lt;br&gt; Like our time is running out&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna change you like a remix&lt;br&gt; Then I'll raise you like a phoenix&lt;br&gt; You're wearing our vintage misery&lt;br&gt; No, I think it looked a little better on me&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna change you like a remix&lt;br&gt; Then I'll raise you like a phoenix&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hey young blood&lt;br&gt; Doesn't it feel&lt;br&gt; Like our time is running out&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna change you like a remix&lt;br&gt; Then I'll raise you like a phoenix&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Put on your war paint</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Day after day&lt;br&gt; Time passed away &lt;br&gt; And I just can't get you out of my mind &lt;br&gt; Nobody knows, I hide it inside &lt;br&gt; I keep on searching but I just can't find &lt;br&gt; The courage to show to let you know&lt;br&gt; I've never felt love like this before &lt;br&gt; And once again I'm thinking about &lt;br&gt; Taking the easy way out &lt;br&gt; [CHORUS]&lt;br&gt; But if I let you go I will never know &lt;br&gt; What my life would be holding you close to me &lt;br&gt; Will I ever see you smiling back at me ? (oh yeah) &lt;br&gt; How will I know if I let you go ? &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Night after night I hear myself say &lt;br&gt; Why don't this feeling just fade away &lt;br&gt; There's no one like you (no one like you) &lt;br&gt; You speak to my heart (speak to my heart) &lt;br&gt; It's such a a shame we're worlds apart &lt;br&gt; I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose &lt;br&gt; But sooner or later I gotta choose &lt;br&gt; And once again I'm thinking about &lt;br&gt; Taking the easy way out &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [CHORUS]&lt;br&gt; If I let you go I will never know &lt;br&gt; What my life would be, holding you close to me &lt;br&gt; Will I ever see you smiling back at me? (oh yeah) &lt;br&gt; How will I know if I let you go ? &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I let you go ooooh baby &lt;br&gt; Ooooooooohhhhh &lt;br&gt; Once again I'm thinking about &lt;br&gt; Taking the easy way out &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [CHORUS (repeat to fade)]</Lyrics>

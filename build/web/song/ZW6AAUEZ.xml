    <Lyrics>We're a thousand miles from comfort, We have travelled land and sea,&lt;br&gt; But as long as you are with me, There's no place I'd rather be.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I would wait forever, Exalted in the scene,&lt;br&gt; As long as I am with you, My heart continues to beat.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, Strolling so casually,&lt;br&gt; We're different and the same&lt;br&gt; Get you another name&lt;br&gt; Switch up the battery&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you gave me a chance&lt;br&gt; I would take it&lt;br&gt; It's a shot in the dark&lt;br&gt; But I'll make it&lt;br&gt; Know with all of your heart&lt;br&gt; You can't shake me&lt;br&gt; When I am with you&lt;br&gt; There's no place I'd rather be.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; No no no no no&lt;br&gt; No place I'd rather be&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlasting&lt;br&gt; So nothing's incomplete&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity.&lt;br&gt; As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be &lt;br&gt; With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, Strolling so casually,&lt;br&gt; We're different and the same&lt;br&gt; Get you another name&lt;br&gt; Switch up the battery&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you gave me a chance&lt;br&gt; I would take it&lt;br&gt; It's a shot in the dark&lt;br&gt; But I'll make it&lt;br&gt; Know with all of your heart&lt;br&gt; You can't shake me&lt;br&gt; When I am with you&lt;br&gt; There's no place I'd rather be.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; No no no no no&lt;br&gt; No place I'd rather be&lt;br&gt; When I am with you&lt;br&gt; There's no place I'd rather be</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Many nights we've prayed&lt;br&gt; With no proof anyone could hear&lt;br&gt; In our hearts a hopeful song&lt;br&gt; We barely understood&lt;br&gt; Now we are not afraid&lt;br&gt; Although we know there's much to fear&lt;br&gt; We were moving mountains&lt;br&gt; Long before we knew we could&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; There can be miracles&lt;br&gt; When you believe&lt;br&gt; Though hope is frail&lt;br&gt; It's hard to kill&lt;br&gt; Who knows what miracles&lt;br&gt; You can achieve&lt;br&gt; When you believe&lt;br&gt; Somehow you will&lt;br&gt; You will when you believe&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In this time of fear&lt;br&gt; When prayer so often proves in vain&lt;br&gt; Hope seemed like the summer birds&lt;br&gt; Too swiftly flown away&lt;br&gt; Yet now I'm standing here&lt;br&gt; My heart's so full, I can't explain&lt;br&gt; Seeking faith and speaking words&lt;br&gt; I never thought I'd say&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; They don't always happen when you ask&lt;br&gt; And it's easy to give in to your fears&lt;br&gt; But when you're blinded by your pain&lt;br&gt; Can't see your way clear through the rain&lt;br&gt; A small, but still, resilient voice&lt;br&gt; Says help is very near&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]</Lyrics>

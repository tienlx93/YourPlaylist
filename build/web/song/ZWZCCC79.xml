    <Lyrics>And what if I never kiss your lips again&lt;br&gt; Or feel the touch of your sweet embrace&lt;br&gt; How would I ever go on&lt;br&gt; Without you there's no place to belong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well someday love is gonna lead you back to me&lt;br&gt; But 'til it does I'll have an empty heart&lt;br&gt; So I'll just have to believe&lt;br&gt; Somewhere out there you thinking of me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; CHORUS:&lt;br&gt; Until the day I'll let you go&lt;br&gt; Until we say our next hello&lt;br&gt; It's not goodbye&lt;br&gt; 'Til I see you again&lt;br&gt; I'll be right here rememberin' when&lt;br&gt; And if time is on our side&lt;br&gt; There will be no tears to cry&lt;br&gt; On down the road&lt;br&gt; There is one thing I can't deny&lt;br&gt; It's not goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You'd think I'd be strong enough to make it through&lt;br&gt; And rise above when the rain falls down&lt;br&gt; But it's so hard to be strong&lt;br&gt; When you've been missin' somebody so long&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's just a matter of time I'm sure&lt;br&gt; But time takes time and I can't hold on&lt;br&gt; So won't you try as hard as you can&lt;br&gt; To put my broken heart together again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; CHORUS</Lyrics>

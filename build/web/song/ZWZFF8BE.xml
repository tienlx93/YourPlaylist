    <Lyrics>They passed me by, all of those great romances &lt;br&gt; You were I felt robbing me of my rightful chances &lt;br&gt; My picture clear, everything seemed so easy &lt;br&gt; And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go &lt;br&gt; Now it's different, I want you to know &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One of us is crying, one of us is lying &lt;br&gt; In her lonely bed, staring at the ceiling &lt;br&gt; Wishing she was somewhere else instead &lt;br&gt; One of us is lonely; one of us is only waiting for a call &lt;br&gt; Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small &lt;br&gt; Wishing she had never left at all &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I saw myself as a concealed attraction &lt;br&gt; I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action &lt;br&gt; Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving &lt;br&gt; That's how I started the show, one of us had to go &lt;br&gt; Now I've changed, and I want you to know &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One of us is crying, one of us is lying &lt;br&gt; In her lonely bed, staring at the ceiling &lt;br&gt; Wishing she was somewhere else instead &lt;br&gt; One of us is lonely; one of us is only waiting for a call &lt;br&gt; Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small &lt;br&gt; Wishing she had never left at all &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Never left at all, staring at the ceiling &lt;br&gt; Wishing she was somewhere else instead &lt;br&gt; One of us is lonely; one of us is only waiting for a call &lt;br&gt; Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small....</Lyrics>

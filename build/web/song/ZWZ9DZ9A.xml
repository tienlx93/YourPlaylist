    <Lyrics>There's something in your eyes&lt;br&gt; That's far too revealing&lt;br&gt; Why must it be like this&lt;br&gt; A love without feeling&lt;br&gt; Something's wrong with you, I know&lt;br&gt; I see it in your eyes&lt;br&gt; Believe me when I say&lt;br&gt; It's gonna be okay&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I told from the start&lt;br&gt; I won't be demanding (I won't be demanding)&lt;br&gt; If you'll have a change of heart&lt;br&gt; I'll be understanding (I'll be understanding)&lt;br&gt; When love becomes a broken heart&lt;br&gt; And dreams begin to die&lt;br&gt; Believe me when I say&lt;br&gt; We'll work it out someway&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll never try to hold you back&lt;br&gt; I wouldn't try controlling you&lt;br&gt; If it's what you want, it's what I want&lt;br&gt; I want what's best for you&lt;br&gt; And if it's something else that you're looking for&lt;br&gt; I'll be the first to help you try&lt;br&gt; Believe me when I say&lt;br&gt; It's hard to say goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We've lost that loving touch&lt;br&gt; We used to feel so much&lt;br&gt; I tried to hide the truth that's in my eyes&lt;br&gt; (A love without feeling)&lt;br&gt; And when I feel we're not in love&lt;br&gt; I know I'm losing you&lt;br&gt; Believe me when I say&lt;br&gt; We'll work it out someway&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll never try to hold you back&lt;br&gt; I wouldn't try controlling you&lt;br&gt; If it's what you want, it's what I want&lt;br&gt; I want what's best for you&lt;br&gt; And if it's something else that you're looking for&lt;br&gt; I'll be the first to help you try&lt;br&gt; Believe me when I say&lt;br&gt; It's hard to say goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Don't say goodbye &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If it's what you want, it's what I want&lt;br&gt; I want what's best for you</Lyrics>

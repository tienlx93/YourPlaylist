    <Lyrics>A few stolen moments is all that we share&lt;br&gt; You've got your family, and they need you there&lt;br&gt; Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list&lt;br&gt; But no other man's gonna do&lt;br&gt; So I'm saving all my love for you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's not very easy, living all alone&lt;br&gt; My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own&lt;br&gt; But each time I try, I just break down and cry&lt;br&gt; Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue&lt;br&gt; So I'm saving all my love for you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You used to tell me we'd run away together&lt;br&gt; Love gives you the right to be free&lt;br&gt; You said be patient, just wait a little longer&lt;br&gt; But that's just an old fantasy&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more&lt;br&gt; Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door&lt;br&gt; Cause tonight is the night, for a feeling alright&lt;br&gt; We'll be making love the whole night through&lt;br&gt; So I'm saving all my love&lt;br&gt; Yes I'm saving all my love&lt;br&gt; Yes I'm saving all my love for you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; No other woman, is gonna love you more&lt;br&gt; Cause tonight is the night, that I'm feeling alright&lt;br&gt; We'll be making love the whole night through&lt;br&gt; So I'm saving all my love&lt;br&gt; Yeah I'm saving all my lovin&lt;br&gt; Yes I'm saving all my love for you&lt;br&gt; For you, for you</Lyrics>

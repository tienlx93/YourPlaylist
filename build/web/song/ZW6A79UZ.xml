    <Lyrics>Silent love is calling faith&lt;br&gt; To shatter me through your hallways&lt;br&gt; Into echoes you can feel&lt;br&gt; And rehearse the way you heal&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Make them dance&lt;br&gt; Just like you&lt;br&gt; Cause you make me move&lt;br&gt; Yeah you always make me go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll run away with your footsteps&lt;br&gt; I'll build a city that dreams for two&lt;br&gt; And if you lose yourself&lt;br&gt; I will find you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; High on words we almost used&lt;br&gt; We're fireworks with a wet fuse&lt;br&gt; Flying planes with paper wheels&lt;br&gt; To the same achilles heels&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Make them dance&lt;br&gt; Just like you&lt;br&gt; Cause you make me move&lt;br&gt; Yeah you always make me go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll run away with your footsteps&lt;br&gt; I'll build a city that dreams for two&lt;br&gt; And if you lose yourself&lt;br&gt; I will find you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Open up your skies (Turn up your night)&lt;br&gt; To the speed of light (Turn up your night)&lt;br&gt; Put your love in lights (Turn up your night)&lt;br&gt; I will find you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Make them dance&lt;br&gt; Just like you&lt;br&gt; Cause you make me move&lt;br&gt; Yeah you always make me go&lt;br&gt; Yeah you always make me go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll run away with your footsteps&lt;br&gt; I'll build a city that dreams for two&lt;br&gt; And if you lose yourself&lt;br&gt; I will find you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah you always make me go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Turn up your night&lt;br&gt; Turn up your night&lt;br&gt; Turn it up, turn it up&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I will find you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Make them dance&lt;br&gt; Just like you&lt;br&gt; Cause you make me move&lt;br&gt; Yeah you always make me go</Lyrics>

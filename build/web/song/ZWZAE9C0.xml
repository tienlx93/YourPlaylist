    <Lyrics>When i'm in Berlin you're off to London&lt;br&gt; When I'm in New York you're doing Rome&lt;br&gt; All those crazy nights we spend together&lt;br&gt; As voices on the phone&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Wishing we could be more telepathic&lt;br&gt; Tired of the nights I sleep alone&lt;br&gt; Wishing we could redirect the traffic&lt;br&gt; And we find ourselves a home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Can you feel the raindrops in the desert&lt;br&gt; Have you seen the sunrays in the dark&lt;br&gt; Do you feel my love when I'm not present&lt;br&gt; Standing by your side while miles apart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sunshine in the rain&lt;br&gt; Love is still the same&lt;br&gt; Sunshine in the rain&lt;br&gt; Sunshine in the rain&lt;br&gt; Love is still the same&lt;br&gt; Sunshine in the rain&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Even if we call the highest power&lt;br&gt; We can only do one town a time&lt;br&gt; Words are not enough action speaks louder&lt;br&gt; Second time around&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Can you feel the raindrops in the desert&lt;br&gt; Have you seen the sunrays in the dark&lt;br&gt; Do you feel my love when I'm not present&lt;br&gt; Standing by your side while miles apart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sunshine in the rain&lt;br&gt; Love is still the same&lt;br&gt; Sunshine in the rain&lt;br&gt; Sunshine in the rain&lt;br&gt; Love is still the same&lt;br&gt; Sunshine in the rain</Lyrics>

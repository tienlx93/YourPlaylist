    <Lyrics>You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt&lt;br&gt; You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind&lt;br&gt; You keep on flirtin'&lt;br&gt; Cause you know that it's workin'&lt;br&gt; You stuck in my head girl writing the lines&lt;br&gt; Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried&lt;br&gt; Let's light it up like it's our last night&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We're just hanging around&lt;br&gt; Burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's&lt;br&gt; Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby&lt;br&gt; Laying right here naked in my bed&lt;br&gt; I'm just doing my thing&lt;br&gt; You love it when I sing&lt;br&gt; Say it makes you feel like an angel&lt;br&gt; We about to get a little tangled up right about now&lt;br&gt; So girl let's keep burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; Burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; Burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Girl when you want it&lt;br&gt; You know that I'm on it&lt;br&gt; You know that I love lovin' up on you&lt;br&gt; Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance&lt;br&gt; And light it up like it's our last chance&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We're just hanging around&lt;br&gt; Burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's&lt;br&gt; Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby&lt;br&gt; Laying right here dreamin in my bed&lt;br&gt; I'm just doing my thing&lt;br&gt; You love it when I sing&lt;br&gt; Say it makes you feel like an angel&lt;br&gt; We about to get a little tangled up right about now&lt;br&gt; So girl let's keep burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; Burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; Burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I wanna rock it all night&lt;br&gt; Baby girl will you rock it out with me?&lt;br&gt; I wanna crawl through the dark&lt;br&gt; Just to feel your heartbeat against me&lt;br&gt; I wanna rock it all night&lt;br&gt; Baby girl will you rock it out with me?&lt;br&gt; I wanna crawl through the dark&lt;br&gt; Just to feel your heartbeat against me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We're just hanging around&lt;br&gt; Burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's&lt;br&gt; Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby&lt;br&gt; Laying right here naked in my bed&lt;br&gt; I'm just doing my thing&lt;br&gt; You love it when I sing&lt;br&gt; Say it makes you feel like an angel&lt;br&gt; We about to get a little tangled up right about now&lt;br&gt; So girl let's keep burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; Burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; Burnin' it down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I wanna rock it all night&lt;br&gt; Baby girl will you rock it out with me?&lt;br&gt; I wanna crawl through the dark&lt;br&gt; Just to feel your heartbeat against me</Lyrics>

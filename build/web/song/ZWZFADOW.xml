    <Lyrics>Hello Darkness my old friend,&lt;br&gt; I've come to talk with you again,&lt;br&gt; Because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I&lt;br&gt; was sleeping and the vision&lt;br&gt; that was planted in my brain,&lt;br&gt; still remains within the&lt;br&gt; Sounds of Silence&lt;br&gt; In restless dreams I walked alone&lt;br&gt; Narrow streets of cobblestone,&lt;br&gt; 'Neath the halo of a street lamp,&lt;br&gt; I turned my collar to the cold and damp&lt;br&gt; When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light&lt;br&gt; That split the night&lt;br&gt; And touched the sound of silence.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And in the naked light I saw&lt;br&gt; Ten thousand people, maybe more.&lt;br&gt; People talking without speaking,&lt;br&gt; People hearing without listening,&lt;br&gt; People writing songs that voices never share&lt;br&gt; And no one dared&lt;br&gt; Disturb the sound of silence.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And the people bowed and prayed&lt;br&gt; To the neon god they made.&lt;br&gt; And the sign flashed out its warning,&lt;br&gt; In the words that it was forming.&lt;br&gt; And the signs said, The words of the prophets&lt;br&gt; are written on the subway walls&lt;br&gt; And tenement halls.&lt;br&gt; And whisper in the sounds of silence.</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&quot;Hush Hush&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I never needed you to be strong&lt;br&gt; I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs&lt;br&gt; I never needed pain, I never needed strain&lt;br&gt; My love for you was strong enough, you should have known&lt;br&gt; I never needed you for judgement&lt;br&gt; I never needed you to question what I spent&lt;br&gt; I never asked for help, I take care of myself&lt;br&gt; I don't know why you think you gotta hold on me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And it's a little late for conversations&lt;br&gt; There isn't anything for you to say&lt;br&gt; And my eyes hurt, hands shiver,&lt;br&gt; So look at me and listen to me&lt;br&gt; Because&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; I don't want to stay another minute&lt;br&gt; I don't want you to say a single word&lt;br&gt; Hush hush, hush hush&lt;br&gt; There is no other way, I get the final say because&lt;br&gt; I don't want to do this any longer&lt;br&gt; I don't want you, there's nothing left to say&lt;br&gt; Hush hush, hush hush&lt;br&gt; I've already spoken, our love is broken&lt;br&gt; Baby hush hush&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I never needed your corrections&lt;br&gt; On everything from how I act to what I say&lt;br&gt; I never needed words, I never needed hurt&lt;br&gt; I never needed you to be there every day&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for the way I let go&lt;br&gt; On everything I wanted when you came along&lt;br&gt; But I ain't never beatin', broken not defeated&lt;br&gt; I know next to you is not where I belong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And it's a little late for explanations&lt;br&gt; There isn't anything that you can do&lt;br&gt; And my eyes hurt, hands shiver&lt;br&gt; So you will listen when I say&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; No more words&lt;br&gt; No more lies&lt;br&gt; No more crying ooh ooh&lt;br&gt; No more pain&lt;br&gt; No more hurt&lt;br&gt; No more tryin' Oh Oh Yeah&lt;br&gt; Because&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus] &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>She rose out of bed, wipes the sleep out of her eyes&lt;br&gt; I know she's bound to be tired, but she looks so satisfied&lt;br&gt; We stayed up a little late last night&lt;br&gt; I guess I must be doing something right&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause my baby's got a smile on her face&lt;br&gt; My baby's got a smile on her face, oh yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; As soon as I get to work I call her on the phone&lt;br&gt; I wanna tell her that I love her, I can't wait til I get home&lt;br&gt; She doesn't say a word when I walk in&lt;br&gt; Looks like we might not get much sleep again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause my baby's got a smile on her face&lt;br&gt; My baby's got a smile on her face&lt;br&gt; Every time we get together&lt;br&gt; My baby's got a smile on her face&lt;br&gt; Yeah, I wanna make it last forever&lt;br&gt; My baby's got a smile on her (you're gonna take it easy)&lt;br&gt; Just look at her, gotta look at her&lt;br&gt; Take a look at that smile on her face&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

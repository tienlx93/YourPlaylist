    <Lyrics>The cycle repeated&lt;br&gt; as explosions broke in the sky&lt;br&gt; all that I needed&lt;br&gt; was the one thing I couldn't find&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And you were there at the turn&lt;br&gt; Waiting to let me know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We're building it up&lt;br&gt; To break it back down&lt;br&gt; We're building this up&lt;br&gt; To burn it down&lt;br&gt; We can't wait&lt;br&gt; To burn it to the ground&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The colors conflicted&lt;br&gt; as the flames climbed into the clouds&lt;br&gt; I wanted to fix this / but&lt;br&gt; couldn't stop from tearing it down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And you were caught at the turn&lt;br&gt; caught in the burning glow&lt;br&gt; And I was there at the turn&lt;br&gt; Waiting to let you know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You told me yes / You held me high&lt;br&gt; And I believed when you told that lie&lt;br&gt; I played that soldier / You played king&lt;br&gt; And struck me down when I kissed that ring&lt;br&gt; You lost that right / to hold that crown&lt;br&gt; I built you up but you let me down&lt;br&gt; so when you fall / I'll take my turn&lt;br&gt; and fan the flames as your blazes burn</Lyrics>

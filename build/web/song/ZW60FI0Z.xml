    <Lyrics>Remember when&lt;br&gt; I was young and so were you&lt;br&gt; and time stood still and love was all we knew&lt;br&gt; You were the first, so was I&lt;br&gt; We made love and then you cried&lt;br&gt; remember when&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Remember when&lt;br&gt; We vowed the vows and walked the walk &lt;br&gt; Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard&lt;br&gt; We lived and learned, life threw curves&lt;br&gt; There was joy, there was hurt&lt;br&gt; remember when&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Remember when&lt;br&gt; Old ones died and new were born&lt;br&gt; And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged&lt;br&gt; We came together, fell apart&lt;br&gt; And broke each other's hearts&lt;br&gt; remember when&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Remember when&lt;br&gt; The sound of little feet was the music &lt;br&gt; We danced to week to week&lt;br&gt; Brought back the love, we found trust&lt;br&gt; Vowed we'd never give it up&lt;br&gt; remember when&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Remember when &lt;br&gt; Thirty seemed so old&lt;br&gt; Now looking back it's just a stepping stone&lt;br&gt; To where we are, where we've been&lt;br&gt; Said we'd do it all again&lt;br&gt; remember when&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Remember when &lt;br&gt; We said when we turned grey&lt;br&gt; When the children grow up and move away&lt;br&gt; We won't be sad, we'll be glad&lt;br&gt; For all the life we've had&lt;br&gt; And we'll remember when</Lyrics>

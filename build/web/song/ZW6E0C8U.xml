    <Lyrics>When I was a boy,&lt;br&gt; I dreamed of a place in the sky&lt;br&gt; Playing in the fields&lt;br&gt; Battling with my shields&lt;br&gt; Bows made out of twine&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I wish I could see this world again&lt;br&gt; Through those eyes&lt;br&gt; See the child in me&lt;br&gt; In my fantasy&lt;br&gt; Never growing old&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Will we ever feel young again?&lt;br&gt; Will we ever feel young again?&lt;br&gt; Will we ever feel young again?&lt;br&gt; We wanna feel young&lt;br&gt; We wanna feel YOUNG AGAIN!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When I was a boy,&lt;br&gt; I searched for a world that's unknown&lt;br&gt; All we have is fun&lt;br&gt; Everybody run until the sun goes down&lt;br&gt; I wish I could see this world again&lt;br&gt; Through those eyes&lt;br&gt; See the child in me&lt;br&gt; In my fantasy&lt;br&gt; Never growing old&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Will we ever feel young again?&lt;br&gt; Will we ever feel young again?&lt;br&gt; Will we ever feel young again?&lt;br&gt; We wanna feel young&lt;br&gt; We wanna feel YOUNG AGAIN!&lt;br&gt; P/s : no coppy ^^!</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>If our love was a fairy tale&lt;br&gt; I would charge in and rescue you&lt;br&gt; On a yacht baby we would sail&lt;br&gt; To an island where we'd say I do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And if we had babies they would look like you&lt;br&gt; It'd be so beautiful if that came true&lt;br&gt; You don't even know how very special you are&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You leave me breathless&lt;br&gt; You're everything good in my life&lt;br&gt; You leave me breathless&lt;br&gt; I still can't believe that you're mine&lt;br&gt; You just walked out of one of my dreams&lt;br&gt; So beautiful you're leaving me&lt;br&gt; Breathless&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And if our love was a story book&lt;br&gt; We would meet on the very first page&lt;br&gt; The last chapter would be about&lt;br&gt; How I'm thankful for the life we've made&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And if we had babies they would have your eyes&lt;br&gt; I would fall deeper watching you give life&lt;br&gt; You don't even know how very special you are&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You must have been sent from heaven to earth to change me&lt;br&gt; You're like an angel&lt;br&gt; The thing that I feel is stronger than love believe me&lt;br&gt; You're something special&lt;br&gt; I only hope that I'll one day deserve what you've given me&lt;br&gt; But all I can do is try&lt;br&gt; Every day of my life&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]</Lyrics>

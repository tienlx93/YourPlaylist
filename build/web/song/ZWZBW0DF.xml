    <Lyrics>An empty street, an empty house&lt;br&gt; A hole inside my heart&lt;br&gt; I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller.&lt;br&gt; I wonder how, I wonder why, I wonder where they are&lt;br&gt; The days we had, the songs we sang together.(oh yeah)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And all my love, I'm holding on forever&lt;br&gt; Reaching for the love that seems so far&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; So I say a little prayer&lt;br&gt; And hope my dreams will take me there&lt;br&gt; Where the skies are blue, to see you once again... my love.&lt;br&gt; All the seas from coast to coast&lt;br&gt; To find the place I Love The Most&lt;br&gt; Where the fields are green, to see you once again... my love.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I try to read, I go to work&lt;br&gt; I'm laughing with my friends&lt;br&gt; But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking. (oh no)&lt;br&gt; I wonder how, I wonder why, I wonder where they are&lt;br&gt; The days we had, the songs we sang together.(oh yeah)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And all my love, I'm holding on forever&lt;br&gt; Reaching for the love that seems so far&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I say a little prayer&lt;br&gt; And hope my dreams will take me there&lt;br&gt; Where the skies are blue, to see you once again... my love.&lt;br&gt; All the seas from coast to coast&lt;br&gt; To find the place I Love The Most&lt;br&gt; Where the fields are green, to see you once again...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To hold you in my arms&lt;br&gt; To promise you my love&lt;br&gt; To tell you from the heart&lt;br&gt; You're all I'm thinking of&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Reaching for the love that seems so far&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I say a little prayer&lt;br&gt; And hope my dreams will take its there&lt;br&gt; Where the skies are blue, to see you once again... my love.&lt;br&gt; All the seas from coast to coast&lt;br&gt; To find the place I Love The Most&lt;br&gt; Where the fields are green, to see you once again... my love.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Say it in a prayer (my sweet love)&lt;br&gt; Dreams will take it there&lt;br&gt; Where the skies are blue (woah yeah), to see you once again my love. (oh my love)&lt;br&gt; All the seas from coast to coast&lt;br&gt; To find the place I Love The Most&lt;br&gt; Where the fields are green, to see you once again.... My Love.</Lyrics>

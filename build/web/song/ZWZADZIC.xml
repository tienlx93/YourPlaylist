    <Lyrics>&quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I used to think that I could not go on&lt;br&gt; And life was nothing but an awful song&lt;br&gt; But now I know the meaning of true love&lt;br&gt; I'm leaning on the everlasting arms&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I can see it, then I can do it&lt;br&gt; If I just believe it, there's nothing to it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [1]&lt;br&gt; I believe I can fly&lt;br&gt; I believe I can touch the sky&lt;br&gt; I think about it every night and day&lt;br&gt; Spread my wings and fly away&lt;br&gt; I believe I can soar&lt;br&gt; I see me running through that open door&lt;br&gt; I believe I can fly&lt;br&gt; I believe I can fly&lt;br&gt; I believe I can fly&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; See I was on the verge of breaking down&lt;br&gt; Sometimes silence can seem so loud&lt;br&gt; There are miracles in life I must achieve&lt;br&gt; But first I know it starts inside of me, oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I can see it, then I can do it&lt;br&gt; If I just believe it, there's nothing to it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Repeat 1]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hey, cause I believe in me, oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I can see it, then I can do it&lt;br&gt; If I just believe it, there's nothing to it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Repeat 1]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Hey, if I just spread my wings&lt;br&gt; I can fly&lt;br&gt; I can fly&lt;br&gt; I can fly, hey&lt;br&gt; If I just spread my wings&lt;br&gt; I can fly&lt;br&gt; Fly-eye-eye &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

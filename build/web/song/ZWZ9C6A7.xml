    <Lyrics>Closed off from love&lt;br&gt; I didn’t need the pain&lt;br&gt; Once or twice was enough&lt;br&gt; And it was all in vain&lt;br&gt; Time starts to pass&lt;br&gt; Before you know it you’re frozen&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But something happened&lt;br&gt; For the very first time with you&lt;br&gt; My heart melts into the ground&lt;br&gt; Found something true&lt;br&gt; And everyone’s looking round&lt;br&gt; Thinking I’m going crazy&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I don’t care what they say&lt;br&gt; I’m in love with you&lt;br&gt; They try to pull me away&lt;br&gt; But they don’t know the truth&lt;br&gt; My heart’s crippled by the vein&lt;br&gt; That I keep on closing&lt;br&gt; You cut me open and I&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; Keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; I keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; I keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; Keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; Keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; You cut me open&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Trying hard not to hear&lt;br&gt; But they talk so loud&lt;br&gt; Their piercing sounds fill my ears&lt;br&gt; Try to fill me with doubt&lt;br&gt; Yet I know that the goal&lt;br&gt; Is to keep me from falling&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But nothing’s greater&lt;br&gt; Than the rush that comes with your embrace&lt;br&gt; And in this world of loneliness&lt;br&gt; I see your face&lt;br&gt; Yet everyone around me&lt;br&gt; Thinks that I’m going crazy, maybe, maybe&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I don’t care what they say&lt;br&gt; I’m in love with you&lt;br&gt; They try to pull me away&lt;br&gt; But they don’t know the truth&lt;br&gt; My heart’s crippled by the vein&lt;br&gt; That I keep on closing&lt;br&gt; You cut me open and I&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; Keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; I keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; I keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; Keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; Keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; You cut me open&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And it’s draining all of me&lt;br&gt; Oh they find it hard to believe&lt;br&gt; I’ll be wearing these scars&lt;br&gt; For everyone to see&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don’t care what they say&lt;br&gt; I’m in love with you&lt;br&gt; They try to pull me away&lt;br&gt; But they don’t know the truth&lt;br&gt; My heart’s crippled by the vein&lt;br&gt; That I keep on closing&lt;br&gt; You cut me open and I&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; Keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; I keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; I keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; Keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; Keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; You cut me open and I&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; Keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; I keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; I keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; Keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; Keep, keep bleeding love&lt;br&gt; You cut me open and I&lt;br&gt; Keep bleeding&lt;br&gt; Keep, keep bleeding love</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&lt;br&gt; In a small town down in Georgia over forty years ago&lt;br&gt; Her maiden name was Musik til she met that Jackson boy&lt;br&gt; They married young like folks did then, not a penny to their name&lt;br&gt; But they believe the one you vow to love&lt;br&gt; Should always stay the same&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And on the land his daddy gave him, a foundation under way&lt;br&gt; For a love to last forever or until their dying day&lt;br&gt; They built a bond that's strong enough to stand the test of time&lt;br&gt; And a place for us to turn to when our lives were in a bind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And they made their house from a toolshed&lt;br&gt; Grandaddy rolled down on two logs&lt;br&gt; And they built walls all around it&lt;br&gt; And they made that house a home&lt;br&gt; They taught us 'bout good living&lt;br&gt; They taught us right and wrong&lt;br&gt; Lord there'll never be another place&lt;br&gt; In this world I'll call home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; My momma raised five children, four girls then there was me&lt;br&gt; She found her strength with faith in God and love of family&lt;br&gt; She never had a social life, home was all she knew&lt;br&gt; Except the time she took a job, to pay a bill or two&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; My daddy skinned his knuckles on the cars that he repaired&lt;br&gt; He never earned much money but he gave us all he had&lt;br&gt; He never made the front page but he did the best he could&lt;br&gt; And folks drove their cars from miles around &lt;br&gt; To let him look underneath the hood&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And they made their house from a toolshed&lt;br&gt; Grandaddy rolled down on two logs&lt;br&gt; And they built walls all around it&lt;br&gt; And they made that house a home&lt;br&gt; They taught us 'bout good living&lt;br&gt; They taught us right and wrong&lt;br&gt; Lord there'll never be another place&lt;br&gt; In this world I'll call home&lt;br&gt; No there'll never be another place in this world&lt;br&gt; That I'll call Home&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style&lt;br&gt; And so I came to see him, to listen for a while&lt;br&gt; And there he was, this young boy, a stranger to my eyes&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Strumming my pain with his fingers&lt;br&gt; Singing my life with his words&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song&lt;br&gt; Telling my whole life with his words&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I felt all flushed with fever, embarassed by the crowd&lt;br&gt; I felt he'd found my letters and read each one out loud&lt;br&gt; I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Strumming my pain with his fingers&lt;br&gt; Singing my life with his words&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song&lt;br&gt; Telling my whole life with his words&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair&lt;br&gt; And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there&lt;br&gt; But he was there, this stranger, singing clear and loud&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Strumming my pain with his fingers&lt;br&gt; Singing my life with his words&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song&lt;br&gt; Telling my whole life with his words&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>If I could take this moment forever&lt;br&gt; Turn the pages of my mind&lt;br&gt; To another place and time&lt;br&gt; We would never say goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I could find the words I would speak them&lt;br&gt; Then I wouldn't be tongue-tied&lt;br&gt; When I looked into your eyes&lt;br&gt; We would never say goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I could stop the moon ever rising&lt;br&gt; Day would not become the night&lt;br&gt; Wouldn't feel this cold inside&lt;br&gt; And we'd never say goodbye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I wish that our dreams were frozen&lt;br&gt; Then our hearts would not be broken&lt;br&gt; When we let each other go...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I could steal this moment forever&lt;br&gt; Paint a picture-perfect smile&lt;br&gt; So our story stayed alive&lt;br&gt; We would never say goodbye</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I don't like to sleep alone&lt;br&gt; Stay with me, don't go&lt;br&gt; Talk with me for just while&lt;br&gt; So much of you to get to know&lt;br&gt; Reaching out, touching you&lt;br&gt; Leaving all the worries all behind&lt;br&gt; Loving you, the way I do&lt;br&gt; My mouth on yours and yours on mine&lt;br&gt; Marry me or let me live with you&lt;br&gt; Nothing's wrong when love is right&lt;br&gt; Like the man said his song&lt;br&gt; Help me make it through the night&lt;br&gt; Lonelyness, can get you down&lt;br&gt; When you get to thinking no one care&lt;br&gt; Lean on me and I'll lean on you&lt;br&gt; Together we will see it through&lt;br&gt; Oh I don't like to sleep alone&lt;br&gt; Sad to think some folks do&lt;br&gt; No I don't like to sleep alone&lt;br&gt; No one does, do you?&lt;br&gt; No I don't like to sleep alone&lt;br&gt; No one does, do you?</Lyrics>

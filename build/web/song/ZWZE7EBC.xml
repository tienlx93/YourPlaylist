    <Lyrics>Trouble will find you no mater where you go, oh oh.&lt;br&gt; No Matter if you're fast no matter if you're slow, oh oh.&lt;br&gt; The eye of the storm and the cry in the morn, oh oh.&lt;br&gt; Your fine for a while but then start to loose control.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He's there in the dark,&lt;br&gt; he's there in my heart,&lt;br&gt; he waits in the winds&lt;br&gt; he's gotta play a part.&lt;br&gt; Trouble is a friend,&lt;br&gt; yeah trouble is a friend of mine. oh oh!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Trouble is a friend but trouble is a foe, oh oh.&lt;br&gt; And no matter what I feed him he always seems to grow, oh oh.&lt;br&gt; He sees what I see and he knows what I know, oh oh.&lt;br&gt; So don't forget as you ease on down the road.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm.&lt;br&gt; I won't let him win, but im a sucker for his charm.&lt;br&gt; Trouble is a friend,&lt;br&gt; yeah trouble is a friend of mine. Oh oh!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh how I hate the way he makes me feel.&lt;br&gt; And how I try to make him leave; I try.&lt;br&gt; Oh Oh I try!</Lyrics>

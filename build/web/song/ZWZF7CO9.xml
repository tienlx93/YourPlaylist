    <Lyrics>This concrete road used to just be dirt&lt;br&gt; We'd drive out here after work&lt;br&gt; Every Friday night when I was eighteen&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This parking lot used to be a field&lt;br&gt; I parked here in my Oldsmobile&lt;br&gt; Long before the Sonic and the Walgreens&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Not no more&lt;br&gt; Not no more&lt;br&gt; My, oh my&lt;br&gt; Look how the time flies&lt;br&gt; Look how the world changes&lt;br&gt; In the blink of an eye&lt;br&gt; My, oh my&lt;br&gt; Look how the years have flown&lt;br&gt; Turning around before you know it&lt;br&gt; Up and gone&lt;br&gt; Oh my, oh my, oh my&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Times have changed and so have I&lt;br&gt; I once was young and starry-eyed&lt;br&gt; Now I have these bittersweet memories&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Songs were long and gas was cheap&lt;br&gt; No cell phones and water was free&lt;br&gt; Daddy paid and I never had to worry&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh my, oh my, my, my&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh my, oh my, oh my&lt;br&gt; Oh my, oh my, oh my</Lyrics>

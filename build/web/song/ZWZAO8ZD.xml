    <Lyrics>&quot;Love The Way You Lie Part II&quot;&lt;br&gt; (feat. Eminem)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Rihanna]&lt;br&gt; On the first page of our story&lt;br&gt; the future seemed so bright&lt;br&gt; then this thing turned out so evil&lt;br&gt; I don’t know why I’m still surprised&lt;br&gt; even angels have their wicked schemes&lt;br&gt; and you take that to new extremes&lt;br&gt; but you’ll always be my hero&lt;br&gt; even though you’ve lost your mind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Just gonna stand there and watch me burn&lt;br&gt; but that’s all right because I like the way it hurts&lt;br&gt; just gonna stand there and hear me cry&lt;br&gt; but that’s all right because I love the way you lie&lt;br&gt; I love the way you lie&lt;br&gt; Ohhh, I love the way you lie&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Rihanna]&lt;br&gt; Now there’s gravel in our voices&lt;br&gt; glass is shattered from the fight&lt;br&gt; in this tug of war, you’ll always win&lt;br&gt; even when I’m right&lt;br&gt; ‘cause you feed me fables from your hand&lt;br&gt; with violent words and empty threats&lt;br&gt; and it’s sick that all these battles&lt;br&gt; are what keeps me satisfied&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Rihanna]&lt;br&gt; So maybe I’m a masochist&lt;br&gt; I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave&lt;br&gt; til the walls are goin’ up&lt;br&gt; in smoke with all our memories&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Eminem]&lt;br&gt; This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face&lt;br&gt; smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction&lt;br&gt; hush baby, speak softly, tell me I’ll be sorry&lt;br&gt; that you pushed me into the coffee table last night&lt;br&gt; so I can push you off me&lt;br&gt; try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me&lt;br&gt; run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy&lt;br&gt; baby, without you, I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me&lt;br&gt; then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me&lt;br&gt; then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the&lt;br&gt; destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we&lt;br&gt; know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs&lt;br&gt; that we’ll have each other’s backs, ’cause we’re that lucky&lt;br&gt; together, we move mountains, let’s not make mountains out of molehills,&lt;br&gt; you hit me twice, yeah, but who’s countin’?&lt;br&gt; I may have hit you three times, I’m startin’ to lose count&lt;br&gt; but together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain&lt;br&gt; our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refused counsellin’&lt;br&gt; this house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand&lt;br&gt; square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it&lt;br&gt; with you I’m in my fuckin’ mind, without you, I’m out it&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I love the way you lie &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

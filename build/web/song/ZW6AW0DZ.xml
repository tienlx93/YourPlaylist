    <Lyrics>Feeling my way through the darkness&lt;br&gt; Guided by a beating heart&lt;br&gt; I can't tell where the journey will end&lt;br&gt; But I know where it starts﻿&lt;br&gt; They tell me I'm too young to understand&lt;br&gt; They say I'm caught up in a dream&lt;br&gt; Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes&lt;br&gt; Well that's fine by me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So wake me up when it's all over&lt;br&gt; When I'm wiser and I'm older&lt;br&gt; All this time I was finding myself&lt;br&gt; And I didn't know﻿ I was lost&lt;br&gt; [x2]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I tried carrying the weight of the world&lt;br&gt; But I only have two hands&lt;br&gt; I hope I get the chance to travel the world&lt;br&gt; And I don't have any plans&lt;br&gt; I wish that I could stay forever this young&lt;br&gt; Not afraid to close my eyes&lt;br&gt; Life's a game﻿ made for everyone&lt;br&gt; And love is a prize&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So wake﻿ me up when it's all over&lt;br&gt; When I'm wiser and I'm older&lt;br&gt; All this time I was finding myself&lt;br&gt; And I didn't know I was lost&lt;br&gt; [x2]&lt;br&gt; I didn't know I was lost................ ........</Lyrics>

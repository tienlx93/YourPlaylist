    <Lyrics>[Bruno Mars]&lt;br&gt; This one’s for you and me, living out our dreams&lt;br&gt; We’re all right where we should be&lt;br&gt; Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes&lt;br&gt; And now all I wanna see&lt;br&gt; Is a sky full of lighters&lt;br&gt; A sky full of lighters&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Royce Da 5'9&quot;]&lt;br&gt; By the time you hear this I’ll probably already be outtie&lt;br&gt; I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi&lt;br&gt; My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin to blow it&lt;br&gt; And I aint gotta stop the beat a minute&lt;br&gt; To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic&lt;br&gt; Tell him how real he is or how high I am&lt;br&gt; Or how I would kill for him for him to know it&lt;br&gt; I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back&lt;br&gt; So it’s only right that I right till he can march right into that post office and tell em to hang it up&lt;br&gt; Now his career’s Lebron’s jersey in 20 years&lt;br&gt; I’ll stop when I’m at the very top&lt;br&gt; You shitted on me on your way up&lt;br&gt; It’s ’bout to be a scary drop&lt;br&gt; Cause what goes up must come down&lt;br&gt; You going down on something you don’t wanna see like a hairy box&lt;br&gt; Every hour, happy hour now&lt;br&gt; Life is wacky now&lt;br&gt; Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy&lt;br&gt; Now I’m just the cats meooww, ow&lt;br&gt; Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao&lt;br&gt; Ya’ll are doomed&lt;br&gt; I remember when T-Pain aint wanna work with me&lt;br&gt; My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes&lt;br&gt; Cause now I’m in the Aston&lt;br&gt; I went from having my city locked up&lt;br&gt; To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick&lt;br&gt; And now I’m fantastic&lt;br&gt; Compared to a weed high&lt;br&gt; And y’all niggas just gossipin’ like bitches on a radio and TV&lt;br&gt; See me, we fly&lt;br&gt; Y’all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive&lt;br&gt; And how real is that&lt;br&gt; I remember signing my first deal and now I’m the second best I can deal with that&lt;br&gt; Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bruno Mars]&lt;br&gt; You and I know what it’s like to be kicked down&lt;br&gt; Forced to fight&lt;br&gt; But tonight we’re alright&lt;br&gt; So hold up your light&lt;br&gt; Let it shine&lt;br&gt; Cause this one’s for you and me, living out our dreams&lt;br&gt; We’re all right where we should be&lt;br&gt; Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes&lt;br&gt; And now all I wanna see&lt;br&gt; Is a sky full of lighters&lt;br&gt; A sky full of lighters&lt;br&gt; ____hết____</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>[Verse 1]&lt;br&gt; If you want it, take it&lt;br&gt; I should have said it before&lt;br&gt; Tried to hide it, fake it&lt;br&gt; I can't pretend anymore&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Pre-Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I only want to die alive&lt;br&gt; Never by the hands of a broken heart&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna hear you lie tonight&lt;br&gt; Now that I've become who I really am&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus x2]&lt;br&gt; This is the part when I say I don't want it&lt;br&gt; I'm stronger than I've been before&lt;br&gt; This is the part when I break free&lt;br&gt; Cause I can't resist it no more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2]&lt;br&gt; You were better, deeper&lt;br&gt; I was under a spell&lt;br&gt; Like a deadly fear I am, babe&lt;br&gt; On the highway to hell&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus x2]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge]&lt;br&gt; (Our love baby, oooh)&lt;br&gt; The thought on your body&lt;br&gt; I came alive&lt;br&gt; It was lethal&lt;br&gt; It was fatal&lt;br&gt; In my dreams it felt so right&lt;br&gt; But I woke up and pretend&lt;br&gt; Oh baby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus x2]&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I still hear your voice, when you sleep next to me. &lt;br&gt; I still feel your touch in my dreams. &lt;br&gt; Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why. &lt;br&gt; Without you it's hard to survive. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling. &lt;br&gt; And everytime we kiss I swear I can fly. &lt;br&gt; Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. &lt;br&gt; Need you by my side. &lt;br&gt; Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static. &lt;br&gt; And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky. &lt;br&gt; Can't you hear my heart beat so &lt;br&gt; I can't let you go. &lt;br&gt; Want you in my life. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky. &lt;br&gt; They wipe away tears that I cry. &lt;br&gt; The good and the bad times, we've been through them all. &lt;br&gt; You make me rise when I fall. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling. &lt;br&gt; And everytime we kiss I swear I can fly. &lt;br&gt; Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. &lt;br&gt; Need you by my side. &lt;br&gt; Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static. &lt;br&gt; And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky. &lt;br&gt; Can't you hear my heart beat so &lt;br&gt; I can't let you go. &lt;br&gt; Want you in my life&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling. &lt;br&gt; And everytime we kiss I swear I can fly. &lt;br&gt; Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. &lt;br&gt; Need you by my side</Lyrics>

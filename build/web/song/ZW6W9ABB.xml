    <Lyrics>See I’m just another average guy&lt;br&gt; Looking for my perfect girl&lt;br&gt; Still on my way and finding&lt;br&gt; When you dragged me right into your world&lt;br&gt; I was way too blind&lt;br&gt; That hide all my feeling for love&lt;br&gt; But now I finally realize&lt;br&gt; Having you was more than enough&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I’m falling so deep for you now I admit&lt;br&gt; Cuz you are the one in billions that I need&lt;br&gt; Just hold my hand and say that I’m your man&lt;br&gt; Cuz I’m dying for this chance to…&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook]&lt;br&gt; Say I love you love you babe&lt;br&gt; Never gonna change it&lt;br&gt; Say I love you love you babe&lt;br&gt; I just wanna say it&lt;br&gt; Say I…I…I love you&lt;br&gt; I…I…I love you&lt;br&gt; I…I…I love you girl…(x2)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2]&lt;br&gt; Just walking with you in the sun&lt;br&gt; Smiling and having fun&lt;br&gt; And when your lips first touched mine&lt;br&gt; it’s like the time stopped running&lt;br&gt; I can find a million rhymes&lt;br&gt; To claim that you’re the one&lt;br&gt; Promise you in this life&lt;br&gt; I’ll be the guy to trust&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cus you’re the girl that I’m fighting to keep&lt;br&gt; Let me just prove to you how perfect I can be&lt;br&gt; Hold me tight and say that I’m your guy&lt;br&gt; And for the rest of my life I’ll say…&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Rap]&lt;br&gt; Baby girl it’s true&lt;br&gt; I can give it all up for loving you&lt;br&gt; I can picture us standing in the church&lt;br&gt; I’m holding your arm with trust to confirm “I do”&lt;br&gt; And there will be no lying here&lt;br&gt; No crying tears, no fight or fear&lt;br&gt; I promise to you that I’ll be right near&lt;br&gt; So close that your heartbeat I can hear&lt;br&gt; This love is a beautiful fairy tales for only you and me, yeah I can tell&lt;br&gt; Hold my hand until the very end like we were meant to be and we can write it down&lt;br&gt; Cuz my princess she is finally found and we will make a life-time play of ours&lt;br&gt; So let me start by saying this out, singing this loudly</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I know your inside, you're feeling so hollow&lt;br&gt; And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah&lt;br&gt; But I fall for you, I'll never recover&lt;br&gt; If I fall for you, I'll never be the same&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I really want to love somebody&lt;br&gt; I really want to dance the night away&lt;br&gt; I know we're only half way there&lt;br&gt; But you take me all the way, you take me all the way&lt;br&gt; I really want to touch somebody&lt;br&gt; I think about you every single day&lt;br&gt; I know we're only half way there&lt;br&gt; But you take me all the way, you take me all the way&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You're such a hard act for me to follow (oh oh oh)&lt;br&gt; Love me today don't leave me tomorrow, yeah&lt;br&gt; But I fall for you, I'll never recover&lt;br&gt; If I fall for you, I'll never be the same&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I really want to love somebody&lt;br&gt; I really want to dance the night away&lt;br&gt; I know we're only half way there&lt;br&gt; But you take me all the way, you take me all the way&lt;br&gt; I really want to touch somebody&lt;br&gt; I think about you every single day&lt;br&gt; I know we're only half way there&lt;br&gt; But you take me all the way, you take me all the way&lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x3)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost&lt;br&gt; I wanna feel like we never gone, ever stopped&lt;br&gt; I don't what to do, I'm right in front of you&lt;br&gt; Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I really want to love somebody&lt;br&gt; I really want to dance the night away&lt;br&gt; I know we're only half way there&lt;br&gt; But you take me all the way, you take me all the way&lt;br&gt; I really want to touch somebody&lt;br&gt; I think about you every single day&lt;br&gt; I know we're only half way there&lt;br&gt; But you take me all the way, you take me all the way&lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You take me all the way, you take me all the way, yeah ...</Lyrics>

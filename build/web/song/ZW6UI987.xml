    <Lyrics>If I had just one tear running down your cheek&lt;br&gt; Maybe I could cope maybe I'd get some sleep&lt;br&gt; If I had just one moment at your expense&lt;br&gt; Maybe all my misery would be well spent&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah.... Could you cry a little&lt;br&gt; Lie just a little&lt;br&gt; Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain&lt;br&gt; I gave now I 'm wanting&lt;br&gt; Something in return&lt;br&gt; So cry just a little for me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If your love could be caged, honey I would hold the key&lt;br&gt; And conceal it underneath the pile of lies you handed me&lt;br&gt; And you'd hunt those lies&lt;br&gt; They'd be all you'd ever find&lt;br&gt; And that'd be all you'd have to know&lt;br&gt; For me to be fine&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah.... And you'd cry a little&lt;br&gt; Die just a little&lt;br&gt; and baby I would feel just a little less pain&lt;br&gt; I gave now I'm wanting&lt;br&gt; Something in return&lt;br&gt; So cry just a little for me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Give it up baby&lt;br&gt; I hear you're doin' fine&lt;br&gt; Nothins goin save me&lt;br&gt; I can see it it your eyes&lt;br&gt; Some kind of heartache&lt;br&gt; Darlin give it a try&lt;br&gt; I dont want pity&lt;br&gt; I just want what is mine&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah... Could you cry a little&lt;br&gt; Lie just a little&lt;br&gt; Pretend that your're feeling a little more pain&lt;br&gt; I gave now I'm wanting&lt;br&gt; Something in return&lt;br&gt; So cry just a little for me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah... Cry just a little for me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; woo ooo, could you cry a little for me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; yeah, yeah</Lyrics>

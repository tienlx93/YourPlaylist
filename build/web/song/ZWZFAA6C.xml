    <Lyrics>When I look at you&lt;br&gt; I can see the sadness in your eyes&lt;br&gt; In these desperate times&lt;br&gt; We get pushed and shoved from every side&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can't love you if you won't let me&lt;br&gt; Can't touch me if you don't try&lt;br&gt; I can feel you&lt;br&gt; I know that you're ready to take it to the other side&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Let's make the moment right&lt;br&gt; It's now or never&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Even the darkest night&lt;br&gt; Will shine forever&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Love, love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When you walk away&lt;br&gt; There's an empty feeling in my mind&lt;br&gt; As the days go by&lt;br&gt; We get caught up in our separate lives&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you need me&lt;br&gt; You know I'll come running&lt;br&gt; Right to you&lt;br&gt; Just give me a sign&lt;br&gt; I won't leave you&lt;br&gt; We'll make it together&lt;br&gt; And take it to the end of time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Let's make the moment right&lt;br&gt; It's now or never&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Even the darkest night&lt;br&gt; Will shine forever&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Love, love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, I've got a lot of loving to show you&lt;br&gt; You know I'd never want to control you&lt;br&gt; I only want to be by your side&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can't love you if you won't let me&lt;br&gt; Can't touch me if you don't try&lt;br&gt; I can feel you&lt;br&gt; I know that you're ready to take it to the other side&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Let's make the moment right&lt;br&gt; It's now or never&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Even the darkest night&lt;br&gt; Will shine forever&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Love, love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive&lt;br&gt; Alive&lt;br&gt; Love will keep us alive</Lyrics>

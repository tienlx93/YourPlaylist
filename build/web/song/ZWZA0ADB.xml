    <Lyrics>(Ben E. King, Jerry Leiber &amp;amp; Mike Stoller)&lt;br&gt; When the night has come&lt;br&gt; And the land is dark&lt;br&gt; And the moon is the only light we see&lt;br&gt; No I won't be afraid&lt;br&gt; No I won't be afraid&lt;br&gt; Just as long as you stand, stand by me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And darling, darling stand by me&lt;br&gt; Oh, now, now, stand by me&lt;br&gt; Stand by me, stand by me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If the sky that we look upon&lt;br&gt; Should tumble and fall&lt;br&gt; And the mountain should crumble to the sea&lt;br&gt; I won't cry, I won't cry&lt;br&gt; No I won't shed a tear&lt;br&gt; Just as long as you stand, stand by me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And darling, darling stand by me&lt;br&gt; Oh, stand by me&lt;br&gt; Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me&lt;br&gt; Oh, now, now, stand by me&lt;br&gt; Oh, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Darling, darling stand by me&lt;br&gt; Stand by me&lt;br&gt; Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me</Lyrics>

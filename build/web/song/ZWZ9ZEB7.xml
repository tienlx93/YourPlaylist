    <Lyrics>Some kids have and some kids don't&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And some of us are wondering why.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And Mom won't watch the news at night&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There's too much stuff that's making her cry.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We need some help&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Down here on earth&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A thousand prayers, a million words&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But one voice was heard.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A house, a yard, a neighborhood&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Where you could ride your new bike to school.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A kind of world where Mom and Dad&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Still believe the golden rule&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Life's not that simple&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Down here on earth.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A thousand prayers, a million words&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But one voice was heard.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One voice, one simple word, hearts know what to say&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; one dream can change the world&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; keep believing till you find your way&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yesterday while walking home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I saw some kid on Newbury Route&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He pulled a pistol from his bag&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; and tossed it in the river below.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Thanks for the help&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; down here on earth&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A thousand prayers, a million words&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But one voice was heard.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One voice was heard&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One voice was heard</Lyrics>

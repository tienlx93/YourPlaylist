    <Lyrics>Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 1:]&lt;br&gt; I met this girl late last year&lt;br&gt; She said don't you worry if I disappear&lt;br&gt; I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake&lt;br&gt; I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait&lt;br&gt; But then I jump right in&lt;br&gt; A week later returned&lt;br&gt; I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn&lt;br&gt; But I gave her my time for two or three nights&lt;br&gt; Then I put it on pause until the moment was right&lt;br&gt; I went away for months until our paths crossed again&lt;br&gt; She told me I was never looking for a friend&lt;br&gt; Maybe you could swing by my room around 10&lt;br&gt; Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin&lt;br&gt; We'll be in between the sheets until the late AM&lt;br&gt; Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said&lt;br&gt; She's singing&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; Don't fuck with my love&lt;br&gt; That heart is so cold&lt;br&gt; All over my arm&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna know that babe&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; Don't fuck with my love&lt;br&gt; I told her she knows&lt;br&gt; Take aim and reload&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna know that babe&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2:]&lt;br&gt; For a couple weeks I&lt;br&gt; Only want to see her&lt;br&gt; We drink away the days with a take-away pizza&lt;br&gt; Before a text message was the only way to reach her&lt;br&gt; Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her&lt;br&gt; Singing out Aretha&lt;br&gt; All over the track like a feature&lt;br&gt; Never want to sleep I guess that I don't want to either&lt;br&gt; But me and her we make money the same way&lt;br&gt; Four cities, two planes the same day&lt;br&gt; Those shows have never been what it's about&lt;br&gt; But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out&lt;br&gt; I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch&lt;br&gt; But we should get on a plane&lt;br&gt; Or we'll be missing it now&lt;br&gt; Wish I'd have written it down&lt;br&gt; The way that things played out&lt;br&gt; When she was kissing him&lt;br&gt; How? I was confused about&lt;br&gt; She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; Don't fuck with my love&lt;br&gt; That heart is so cold&lt;br&gt; All over my arm&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna know that babe&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; Don't fuck with my love&lt;br&gt; I told her she knows&lt;br&gt; Take aim and reload&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna know that babe&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 3:]&lt;br&gt; [Knock knock knock] on my hotel door&lt;br&gt; I don't even know if she knows what for&lt;br&gt; She was crying on my shoulder&lt;br&gt; I already told ya&lt;br&gt; Trust and respect is what we do this for&lt;br&gt; I never intended to be next&lt;br&gt; But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all&lt;br&gt; And I never saw him as a threat&lt;br&gt; Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course&lt;br&gt; It's not like we were both on tour&lt;br&gt; We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor&lt;br&gt; And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment&lt;br&gt; But it was never just fun and I thought you were different&lt;br&gt; This is not the way you realize what you wanted&lt;br&gt; It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest&lt;br&gt; All this time God knows I'm singing&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus 2x:]&lt;br&gt; Don't fuck with my love&lt;br&gt; That heart is so cold&lt;br&gt; All over my arm&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna know that babe&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah&lt;br&gt; Don't fuck with my love&lt;br&gt; I told her she knows&lt;br&gt; Take aim and reload&lt;br&gt; I don't wanna know that babe&lt;br&gt; Ah lahmlahlah</Lyrics>

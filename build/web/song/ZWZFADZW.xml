    <Lyrics>Don't go changing, to try and please me,&lt;br&gt; You never let me down before,&lt;br&gt; Don't imagine, you're too familiar,&lt;br&gt; And I don't see you anymore.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I would not leave you, in times of trouble,&lt;br&gt; We never could have come this far,&lt;br&gt; I took the good times, I'll take the bad times,&lt;br&gt; I'll take you just the way you are.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Don't go trying, some new fashion,&lt;br&gt; Don't change the colour of your hair,&lt;br&gt; You always have my, unspoken passion,&lt;br&gt; Although I might not seem to care.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't want clever, conversation,&lt;br&gt; I never want to work that hard,&lt;br&gt; I just want someone, that I can talk to,&lt;br&gt; I want you just the way you are.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I need to know that you will always be&lt;br&gt; The same old someone that I knew,&lt;br&gt; What will it take till you believe in me,&lt;br&gt; The way that I believe in you?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I said I love you, and that's forever,&lt;br&gt; And this I promise from the heart,&lt;br&gt; I couldn't love you, any better,&lt;br&gt; I love you just the way you are.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't want clever, conversation,&lt;br&gt; I never want to work that hard,&lt;br&gt; I just want someone, that I can talk to,&lt;br&gt; I want you just the way you are.</Lyrics>

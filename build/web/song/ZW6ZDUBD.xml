    <Lyrics>There's a stone for the things forgotten&lt;br&gt; Just a stone for all you wanted&lt;br&gt; Look, a stone for what will not be&lt;br&gt; All you thought was there&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Count the stones don't think about him&lt;br&gt; Let the stones become your mountain&lt;br&gt; Let them go the nights you doubted&lt;br&gt; All those thousand cares&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Softly now thread&lt;br&gt; Through the towns and the dark&lt;br&gt; Softly be led&lt;br&gt; By the clouds and the stars&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When the distances grow&lt;br&gt; When the winds start to blow&lt;br&gt; Something whispers from afar&lt;br&gt; There's a home in the heart&lt;br&gt; Another heaven&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There's a time for everything&lt;br&gt; There's a song for every dream&lt;br&gt; (There's a song)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There's a stone for every action&lt;br&gt; For the things you won't look back on&lt;br&gt; Look, a stone for all that will be&lt;br&gt; All that still is me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Softly now thread&lt;br&gt; Through the sounds of the dark&lt;br&gt; Softly be led&lt;br&gt; By the clouds and the stars&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When the distances grow&lt;br&gt; When the winds start to blow&lt;br&gt; Something whispers from afar&lt;br&gt; There's a home in the heart&lt;br&gt; Another heaven&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There's a time for everything&lt;br&gt; There's a song for every dream&lt;br&gt; There's a world that's yet to be&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There's a time for everything&lt;br&gt; There's a song for every dream</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Oh no, did I get too close?&lt;br&gt; Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?&lt;br&gt; All your insecurities&lt;br&gt; All the dirty laundry&lt;br&gt; Never made me blink one time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Unconditional, unconditionally&lt;br&gt; I will love you unconditionally&lt;br&gt; There is no fear now&lt;br&gt; Let go and just be free&lt;br&gt; I will love you unconditionally&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2]&lt;br&gt; Come just as you are to me&lt;br&gt; Don't need apologies&lt;br&gt; Know that you are unworthy&lt;br&gt; I'll take your bad days with your good&lt;br&gt; Walk through this storm I would&lt;br&gt; I'd do it all because I love you, I love you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Unconditional, unconditionally&lt;br&gt; I will love you unconditionally&lt;br&gt; There is no fear now&lt;br&gt; Let go and just be free&lt;br&gt; I will love you unconditionally&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Middle 8]&lt;br&gt; So open up your heart and just let it begin&lt;br&gt; Open up your heart, and just let it begin&lt;br&gt; Open up your heart, and just let it begin&lt;br&gt; Open up your heart&lt;br&gt; Acceptance is the key to be&lt;br&gt; To be truly free&lt;br&gt; Will you do the same for me?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; Unconditional, unconditionally&lt;br&gt; I will love you unconditionally&lt;br&gt; And there is no fear now&lt;br&gt; Let go and just be free&lt;br&gt; 'Cause I will love you unconditionally (oh yeah)</Lyrics>

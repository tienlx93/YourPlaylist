    <Lyrics>[Avril Lavigne]&lt;br&gt; Love that once hung on the wall&lt;br&gt; Used to mean something, but now it means nothing&lt;br&gt; The echoes are gone in the hall&lt;br&gt; But I still remember, the pain of december&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry it's too late&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I'm breaking free from these memories&lt;br&gt; Gotta let it go, just let it go&lt;br&gt; I've said goodbye&lt;br&gt; Set it all on fire&lt;br&gt; Gotta let it go, just let it go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chad Kroeger]&lt;br&gt; You came back to find I was gone&lt;br&gt; And that place is empty, like the hole that was left in me&lt;br&gt; Like we were nothing at all&lt;br&gt; It's not that you meant to me&lt;br&gt; Thought we were meant to be&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry it's too late&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I'm breaking free from these memories&lt;br&gt; Gotta let it go, just let it go&lt;br&gt; I've said goodbye&lt;br&gt; Set it all on fire&lt;br&gt; Gotta let it go, just let it go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I let it go, and now I know&lt;br&gt; A brand new life, this tale is rude&lt;br&gt; Where it's right, you always know&lt;br&gt; So this time, I won't let go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There's only one thing left here to say&lt;br&gt; Love's never too late&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I've broken free from these memories&lt;br&gt; I've let it go, I've let it go&lt;br&gt; And two goodbyes, lend you this new life&lt;br&gt; Don't let me go, don't let me go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Won't let you go, don't let me go&lt;br&gt; Won't let you go, don't let me go</Lyrics>

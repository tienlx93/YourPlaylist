    <Lyrics>Look at us baby, up all night &lt;br&gt; Tearing our love apart &lt;br&gt; Aren't we the same two people who live &lt;br&gt; through years in the dark? &lt;br&gt; Ahh... &lt;br&gt; Every time I try to walk away &lt;br&gt; Something makes me turn around and stay &lt;br&gt; And I can't tell you why &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When we get crazy, &lt;br&gt; it just ain't to right, &lt;br&gt; (try to keep you head, little girl) &lt;br&gt; Girl, I get lonely, too &lt;br&gt; You don't have to worry &lt;br&gt; Just hold on tight &lt;br&gt; (don't get caught in your little world) &lt;br&gt; 'Cause I love you &lt;br&gt; Nothing's wrong as far as I can see &lt;br&gt; We make it harder than it has to be &lt;br&gt; and I can't tell you why &lt;br&gt; no, baby, I can't tell you why &lt;br&gt; I can't tell you why &lt;br&gt; No, no, baby, I can't tell you why &lt;br&gt; I can't tell you why &lt;br&gt; I can't tell you why</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Said goodbye, turned around&lt;br&gt; And you were gone, gone, gone&lt;br&gt; Faded into the setting sun,&lt;br&gt; Slipped away&lt;br&gt; But I won’t cry&lt;br&gt; Cause I know I’ll never be lonely&lt;br&gt; For you are the stars to me,&lt;br&gt; You are the light I follow&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; I’ll See you again, oh&lt;br&gt; This is not where it ends&lt;br&gt; I will carry you with me, oh&lt;br&gt; Till I see you again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I can hear those echoes in the wind at night&lt;br&gt; Calling me back in time&lt;br&gt; Back to you&lt;br&gt; In a place far away&lt;br&gt; Where the water meets the sky&lt;br&gt; The thought of it makes me smile&lt;br&gt; You are my tomorrow&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; I’ll See you again, oh&lt;br&gt; This is not where it ends&lt;br&gt; I will carry you with me, oh&lt;br&gt; Till I see you again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge:]&lt;br&gt; Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking&lt;br&gt; But I stay strong and I hold on cause I know&lt;br&gt; I’ll see you again, oh&lt;br&gt; This is not where it ends&lt;br&gt; I will carry you with me, yeah yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Outro:]&lt;br&gt; I’ll See you again, oh&lt;br&gt; This is not where it ends&lt;br&gt; I will carry you with me, oh&lt;br&gt; Till I see you again&lt;br&gt; Till I see you again,&lt;br&gt; Till I see you again,&lt;br&gt; Said goodbye turned around&lt;br&gt; And you were gone, gone, gone.</Lyrics>

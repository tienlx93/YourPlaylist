    <Lyrics>Strumming my pain with his fingers,&lt;br&gt; Singing my life with his words,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; Telling my whole life with his words,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song …I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.&lt;br&gt; And so I came to see him to listen for a while.&lt;br&gt; And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Strumming my pain with his fingers,&lt;br&gt; Singing my life with his words,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; Telling my whole life with his words,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song …&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,&lt;br&gt; I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.&lt;br&gt; I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on …&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Strumming my pain with his fingers,&lt;br&gt; Anh&lt;br&gt; Singing my life with his words,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Telling my whole life with his words,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song …&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair.&lt;br&gt; And then he looked right through me as if I wasn’t there.&lt;br&gt; But he just came to singing, singing clear and strong.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Strumming my pain with his fingers,&lt;br&gt; Singing my life with his words,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; Telling my whole life with his words,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song …&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He was strumming, oh, he was singing my life.&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song,&lt;br&gt; Telling my whole life with his words,&lt;br&gt; Killing me softly with his song …&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With his song …</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Just a gentle whisper, told me that you'd gone&lt;br&gt; Leaving only memories, where did we go wrong?&lt;br&gt; I couldn't find the words then, so let me say them now&lt;br&gt; I'm still in love with you&lt;br&gt; Tell me that you love me, tell me that you care&lt;br&gt; Tell me that you need me, and I'll be there&lt;br&gt; I'll be there waiting&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I will always love you, I will always stay true&lt;br&gt; There's no one who loves you like I do&lt;br&gt; Come to me now&lt;br&gt; I will never leave you, I will stay here with you&lt;br&gt; Through the good and bad I will stand true&lt;br&gt; I'm in love with you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now we're here together, yesterday has past&lt;br&gt; Life is just beginning, close to you at last&lt;br&gt; And I promise to you, I will always be there&lt;br&gt; I give my all to you&lt;br&gt; Living life without you is more than I can bear&lt;br&gt; Hold me close forever,&lt;br&gt; I'll be there....&lt;br&gt; I'll be there for you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I will always love you, I will always stay true&lt;br&gt; There's no one who loves you like I do&lt;br&gt; This I promise...&lt;br&gt; I will never leave you, I will stay here with you&lt;br&gt; Through the good and bad I will stand true&lt;br&gt; Hold me closer...&lt;br&gt; Our love is forever, holding us together&lt;br&gt; Nothing in this world can stop us now&lt;br&gt; Love has found, love has found a way&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm in love, I'm in love&lt;br&gt; Yes, I'm in love, so in love&lt;br&gt; I'm in love with you</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Suppose I called you up tonight&lt;br&gt; And told you that I love you&lt;br&gt; And suppose I said I wanna come back home&lt;br&gt; And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson&lt;br&gt; And I'm tired of spending all my time alone&lt;br&gt; If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted&lt;br&gt; And it's killing me to be so far away&lt;br&gt; Would you tell me that you love me too&lt;br&gt; And would we cry together&lt;br&gt; Or would you simply laugh at me and say&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I told you so&lt;br&gt; Oh, I told you so&lt;br&gt; I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in&lt;br&gt; I told you so&lt;br&gt; But you had to go&lt;br&gt; Now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever&lt;br&gt; Would you get down on yours too and take my hand&lt;br&gt; Would we get that old time feeling&lt;br&gt; Would we laugh and talk for hours&lt;br&gt; The way we did when our love first began&lt;br&gt; Would you tell me that you've missed me too&lt;br&gt; And that you've been so lonely&lt;br&gt; And you've waited for the day that I returned&lt;br&gt; And we'd live and love forever&lt;br&gt; And that I'm your one and only&lt;br&gt; Or would you say the tables finally turned&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Would you say I told you so&lt;br&gt; Oh, I told you so&lt;br&gt; I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in&lt;br&gt; I told you so&lt;br&gt; But you had to go&lt;br&gt; Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

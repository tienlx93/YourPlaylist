    <Lyrics>When your legs don't work like they used to before&lt;br&gt; And I can't sweep you off of your feet&lt;br&gt; Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love&lt;br&gt; Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And darling I will be loving you till we're 70&lt;br&gt; And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23&lt;br&gt; And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways&lt;br&gt; Maybe just the touch of a hand&lt;br&gt; Oh me I fall in love with you every single day&lt;br&gt; And I just wanna tell you I am&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So honey now&lt;br&gt; Take me into your loving arms&lt;br&gt; Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars&lt;br&gt; Place your head on my beating heart&lt;br&gt; I'm thinking out loud&lt;br&gt; That maybe we found love right where we are&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When my hair's overgone and my memory fades&lt;br&gt; And the crowds don't remember my name&lt;br&gt; When my hands don't play the strings the same way&lt;br&gt; I know you will still love me the same&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen&lt;br&gt; And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory&lt;br&gt; I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways&lt;br&gt; Maybe it's all part of a plan&lt;br&gt; I just keep on making the same mistakes&lt;br&gt; Hoping that you'll understand&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But baby now&lt;br&gt; Take me into your loving arms&lt;br&gt; Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars&lt;br&gt; Place your head on my beating heart&lt;br&gt; Thinking out loud&lt;br&gt; That maybe we found love right where we are&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So baby now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Take me into your loving arms&lt;br&gt; Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars&lt;br&gt; Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart&lt;br&gt; I'm thinking out loud&lt;br&gt; That maybe we found love right where we are&lt;br&gt; Oh maybe we found love right where we are&lt;br&gt; And we found love right where we are</Lyrics>

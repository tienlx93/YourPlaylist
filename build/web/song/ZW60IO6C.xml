    <Lyrics>Lyin' in my bed I hear the clock tick&lt;br&gt; And think of you&lt;br&gt; Caught up in circles confusion&lt;br&gt; Is nothing new&lt;br&gt; Flashback warm nights&lt;br&gt; Almost left behind&lt;br&gt; Suitcase of memories&lt;br&gt; Time after&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sometimes you picture me&lt;br&gt; I'm walking too far ahead&lt;br&gt; You're calling to me I can't hear&lt;br&gt; What you've said&lt;br&gt; Then you say go slow&lt;br&gt; I fall behind&lt;br&gt; The second hand unwinds&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you're lost you can look and you will find me&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you're lost you can look and you will find me&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; After my picture fades and darkness&lt;br&gt; Has turned to gray&lt;br&gt; Watching through windows&lt;br&gt; You're wondering if I'm okay&lt;br&gt; Secrets stolen from deep inside&lt;br&gt; The drum beats out of time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you're lost you can look and you will find me&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You said go slow&lt;br&gt; I fall behind&lt;br&gt; The second hand unwinds&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you're lost you can look and you will find me&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If you're lost you can look and you will find me&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; Time after time&lt;br&gt; ...</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Remember the feelings, remember the day&lt;br&gt; My stone heart was breaking&lt;br&gt; My love ran away&lt;br&gt; This moments I knew I would be someone else&lt;br&gt; My love turned around and I fell&lt;br&gt; Be my bad boy, be my man&lt;br&gt; Be my week-end lover&lt;br&gt; But don't be my friend&lt;br&gt; You can be my bad boy&lt;br&gt; But understand&lt;br&gt; That I don't need you in my life again&lt;br&gt; Won't you be my bad boy, be my man&lt;br&gt; Be my week-end lover&lt;br&gt; But don't be my friend&lt;br&gt; You can be my bad boy&lt;br&gt; But understand&lt;br&gt; That I don't need you again&lt;br&gt; No I don't need you again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You once made this promise&lt;br&gt; To stay by my side&lt;br&gt; But after some time you just pushed me aside&lt;br&gt; You never thought that a girl could be strong&lt;br&gt; Now I'll show you how to go on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Be my bad boy, be my man&lt;br&gt; Be my week-end lover&lt;br&gt; But don't be my friend&lt;br&gt; You can be my bad boy&lt;br&gt; But understand&lt;br&gt; That I don't need you in my life again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Won't you be my bad boy, be my man&lt;br&gt; Be my week-end lover&lt;br&gt; But don't be my friend&lt;br&gt; You can be my bad boy&lt;br&gt; But understand&lt;br&gt; That I don't need you again&lt;br&gt; No I don't need you again</Lyrics>

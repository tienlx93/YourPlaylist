    <Lyrics>If I die young, bury me in satin&lt;br&gt; Lay me down on a, bed of roses&lt;br&gt; Sink me in the river, at dawn&lt;br&gt; Send me away with the words of a love song&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Uh oh, uh oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Lord make me a rainbow, I’ll shine down on my mother&lt;br&gt; She'll know I’m safe with you when she stands under my colors, oh and&lt;br&gt; Life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no&lt;br&gt; Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The sharp knife of a short life, well&lt;br&gt; I’ve had, just enough time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I die young, bury me in satin&lt;br&gt; Lay me down on a, bed of roses&lt;br&gt; Sink me in the river, at dawn&lt;br&gt; Send me away with the words of a love song&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The sharp knife of a short life, well&lt;br&gt; I’ve had, just enough time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I’ll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom&lt;br&gt; I’m as green as the ring on my little, cold finger, I’ve&lt;br&gt; Never known the lovin' of a man&lt;br&gt; But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand, there’s a&lt;br&gt; Boy here in town says he’ll, love my forever&lt;br&gt; Who would have thought forever could be severed by&lt;br&gt; The sharp knife of a short life, well&lt;br&gt; I’ve had, just enough time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So put on your best boys and I’ll wear my pearls&lt;br&gt; What I never did is done&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I’ll sell them for a dollar&lt;br&gt; They're worth so much more after I’m a goner&lt;br&gt; And maybe then you’ll hear the words I been singin’&lt;br&gt; Funny when your dead how people start listenin’&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I die young, bury me in satin&lt;br&gt; Lay me down on a, bed of roses&lt;br&gt; Sink me in the river, at dawn&lt;br&gt; Send me away with the words of a love song&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Uh oh (uh, oh)&lt;br&gt; The ballad of a dove (uh, oh)&lt;br&gt; Go with peace and love&lt;br&gt; Gather up your tears, keep ‘em in your pocket&lt;br&gt; Save them for a time when your really gonna need them, oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The sharp knife of a short life, well&lt;br&gt; I’ve had, just enough time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So put on your best boys and I’ll wear my pearls</Lyrics>

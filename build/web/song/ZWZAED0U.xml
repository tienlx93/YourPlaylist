    <Lyrics>When the rains blowing in your face&lt;br&gt; And the whole world is on your case&lt;br&gt; I would offer you a warm embrace&lt;br&gt; To make you feel my love&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When evening shadows and the stars appear&lt;br&gt; And there is no one to dry your tears&lt;br&gt; I could hold you for a million years&lt;br&gt; To make you feel my love&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I know you haven't made your mind up yet&lt;br&gt; But I would never do you wrong&lt;br&gt; I've known it from the moment that we met&lt;br&gt; There’s no doubt in my mind where you belong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue&lt;br&gt; I'd go crawling down the avenue&lt;br&gt; There ain’t nothing that I wouldn't do&lt;br&gt; To make you feel my love&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Mmmm&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The storms are raging on a rollin' sea&lt;br&gt; And down the highway of regret&lt;br&gt; The winds of change are blowing wild and free&lt;br&gt; Yeah but you ain't seen nothing like me yet&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There ain’t nothing that I wouldn't do&lt;br&gt; Go to the ends of the earth for you&lt;br&gt; Make you happy, make your dreams come true&lt;br&gt; To make you feel my love</Lyrics>

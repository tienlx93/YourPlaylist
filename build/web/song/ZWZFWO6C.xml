    <Lyrics>Not sure if you know this&lt;br&gt; but when we first met&lt;br&gt; I got so nervous&lt;br&gt; I couldn’t speak&lt;br&gt; In that very moment&lt;br&gt; I found the one&lt;br&gt; and my life had found its missing piece&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So as long as I live I’ll love you,&lt;br&gt; will have and hold you&lt;br&gt; You look so beautiful in white&lt;br&gt; And from now till my very last breath&lt;br&gt; This day I’ll cherish&lt;br&gt; You look so beautiful in white tonight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What we have is timeless&lt;br&gt; My love is endless&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; and with this ring I say to the world&lt;br&gt; You’re my every reason&lt;br&gt; You’re all that I believe in&lt;br&gt; With all my heart I mean every word&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So as long as I live I’ll love you,&lt;br&gt; will have and hold you&lt;br&gt; You look so beautiful in white&lt;br&gt; And from now till my very last breath&lt;br&gt; This day I’ll cherish&lt;br&gt; You look so beautiful in white tonight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; ohh ohh&lt;br&gt; You look so beautiful in white tonight&lt;br&gt; na na na na&lt;br&gt; so beautiful in white tonight&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And if a daughter is what our future holds&lt;br&gt; I hope she has your eyes&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; finds love like you and I did&lt;br&gt; and when she falls in love we’ll let her go&lt;br&gt; and I’ll walk her down the aisle&lt;br&gt; She’ll look so beautiful in white&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You look so beautiful in white&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So as long as I live I’ll love you,&lt;br&gt; will have and hold you&lt;br&gt; You look so beautiful in white&lt;br&gt; And from now till my very last breath&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This day I’ll cherish&lt;br&gt; You look so beautiful in white tonight</Lyrics>

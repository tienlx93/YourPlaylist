    <Lyrics>No I can't take one more step towards you&lt;br&gt; Cause all that's waiting is regret&lt;br&gt; And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore&lt;br&gt; You lost the love I loved the most&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I learned to live half alive&lt;br&gt; And now you want me one more time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And who do you think you are&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Running around leaving scars&lt;br&gt; Collecting your jar of hearts&lt;br&gt; And tearing love apart&lt;br&gt; You're gonna catch a cold&lt;br&gt; From the ice inside your soul&lt;br&gt; So don't come back for me&lt;br&gt; Who do you think you are&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I hear your asking all around&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; If I am anywhere to be found&lt;br&gt; But I have grown too strong&lt;br&gt; To ever fall back in your arms&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I learned to live half alive&lt;br&gt; And now you want me one more time&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And who do you think you are&lt;br&gt; Running around leaving scars&lt;br&gt; Collecting your jar of hearts&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And tearing love apart&lt;br&gt; You're gonna catch a cold&lt;br&gt; From the ice inside your soul&lt;br&gt; So don't come back for me&lt;br&gt; Who do you think you are&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And it took so long just to feel alright&lt;br&gt; Remember how to put back the light in my eyes&lt;br&gt; I wish I would have missed the first time that we kissed&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause you broke all your promises&lt;br&gt; And now your back&lt;br&gt; You don't get to get me back&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And who do you think you are&lt;br&gt; Running around leaving scars&lt;br&gt; Collecting your jar of hearts&lt;br&gt; And tearing love apart&lt;br&gt; You're gonna catch a cold&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; From the ice inside your soul&lt;br&gt; Don't come back for me&lt;br&gt; Don't come back at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And who do you think you are&lt;br&gt; Running around leaving scars&lt;br&gt; Collecting your jar of hearts&lt;br&gt; And tearing love apart&lt;br&gt; You're gonna catch a cold&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; From the ice inside your soul&lt;br&gt; Don't come back for me&lt;br&gt; Don't come back at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Who do you think you are&lt;br&gt; Who do you think you are&lt;br&gt; Who do you think you are</Lyrics>

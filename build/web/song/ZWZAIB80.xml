    <Lyrics>As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility&lt;br&gt; I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me&lt;br&gt; So I want to take this time out and apologize for things I have done&lt;br&gt; And things that have not occurred yet&lt;br&gt; And the things they don't want to take responsibility for&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for the times I left you home&lt;br&gt; I was on the road and you were alone&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for the times that I had to go&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know&lt;br&gt; That you were sitting home just wishing we&lt;br&gt; Could go back to when it was just you and me&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for the times I would neglect&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for the times I disrespect&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry I'm not always there for my son&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for the fact that I am not aware&lt;br&gt; That you can't sleep at night when I am not there&lt;br&gt; Because I am in the streets like everyday&lt;br&gt; Sorry for the things that I did not say&lt;br&gt; Like how you are the best thing in my world&lt;br&gt; And how I am so proud to call you my girl&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge]&lt;br&gt; I understand that there are some problems&lt;br&gt; And I am not too blind to know&lt;br&gt; All the pain you kept inside you&lt;br&gt; Even though you might not show&lt;br&gt; If I can apologize for being wrong&lt;br&gt; Then it's just a shame on me&lt;br&gt; I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; You can put the blame on me [4x]&lt;br&gt; Said you can put the blame on me [3x]&lt;br&gt; You can put the blame on me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sorry for the things that he put you through&lt;br&gt; And all the times you didn't know what to do&lt;br&gt; Sorry that you had to go and sell those packs&lt;br&gt; Just trying to stay busy till you heard from Dad&lt;br&gt; And you would rather be home with all your kids&lt;br&gt; As one big family with love and bliss&lt;br&gt; And even though Pops treated us like kings&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He got a second wife and you didn't agree&lt;br&gt; He got up and left you there all alone&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry that your son was once a thief&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast&lt;br&gt; I wish I would've listened and not be so bad&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry your life turned out this way&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry the FEDS came and took me away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm sorry that it took so long to see&lt;br&gt; They were dead wrong trying to put it on me&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry that it took so long to speak&lt;br&gt; But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt&lt;br&gt; For the embarrassment that she felt&lt;br&gt; Just a little young girl trying to have fun&lt;br&gt; Her daddy should never let her out that young&lt;br&gt; I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down&lt;br&gt; I hope they manage better next time around&lt;br&gt; How was I to know she was underage&lt;br&gt; Enter 21 you know the club they say&lt;br&gt; Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame&lt;br&gt; For rising back out disgracing my name&lt;br&gt; I'm just a singer trying to entertain&lt;br&gt; Because I love my fans I'll take that blame&lt;br&gt; Even though the blame's on you [3x]&lt;br&gt; I'll take that blame from you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And you can put that blame on me [2x]&lt;br&gt; You can put that blame on me&lt;br&gt; And you can put that blame on me</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>[Verse 1]&lt;br&gt; In between the coats in the closet&lt;br&gt; She held on to that heart shaped locket&lt;br&gt; Staring at a family flawless&lt;br&gt; But it ain't a pretty picture tonight&lt;br&gt; Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it&lt;br&gt; Fighting at the drop of a faucet&lt;br&gt; Cuts through the walls catastrophic&lt;br&gt; She's caught in the crossfire&lt;br&gt; Puts her hands over her ears&lt;br&gt; Starts talking through her tears&lt;br&gt; She's saying, she's praying.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I wish words were like little toy guns&lt;br&gt; No sting, no hurt no one, Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue&lt;br&gt; (I wish words were like little toy guns)&lt;br&gt; No smoke, no bullets, no kick from the trigger when you pull it&lt;br&gt; No pain, no damage done&lt;br&gt; (I wish words were like little toy guns)&lt;br&gt; Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue&lt;br&gt; (I wish words were like little toy guns)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2]&lt;br&gt; Wish there was a white flag waving or that they were both just faking&lt;br&gt; And it was just a game they were playing like shoot'em up cowboys&lt;br&gt; Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard&lt;br&gt; Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise.&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>The smile on your face lets me know that you need me&lt;br&gt; There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me&lt;br&gt; The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall&lt;br&gt; You say it best.. when you say nothing at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; All day long I can hear people talking out loud&lt;br&gt; But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd (the crowd)&lt;br&gt; Try as they may they can never define&lt;br&gt; What's been said between your heart and mine&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The smile on your face lets me know that you need me&lt;br&gt; There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me&lt;br&gt; The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall&lt;br&gt; You say it best.. when you say nothing at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The smile on your face lets me know that you need me&lt;br&gt; There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me&lt;br&gt; The touch of your hand says you'll catch me whenever I fall&lt;br&gt; You say it best.. when you say nothing at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (You say it best when you say nothing at all&lt;br&gt; You say it best when you say nothing at all..)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The smile on your face&lt;br&gt; The truth in your eyes&lt;br&gt; The touch of your hand&lt;br&gt; Let's me know that you need me..</Lyrics>

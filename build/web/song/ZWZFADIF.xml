    <Lyrics>Another summer day&lt;br&gt; Has come and gone away&lt;br&gt; In Paris and Rome&lt;br&gt; But I wanna go home&lt;br&gt; Mmmmmmmm&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; May be surrounded by&lt;br&gt; A million people I&lt;br&gt; Still feel all alone&lt;br&gt; I just wanna go home&lt;br&gt; Oh, I miss you, you know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I’ve been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you&lt;br&gt; Each one a line or two&lt;br&gt; “I’m fine baby, how are you?”&lt;br&gt; Well I would send them but I know that it’s just not enough&lt;br&gt; My words were cold and flat&lt;br&gt; And you deserve more than that&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Another aeroplane&lt;br&gt; Another sunny place&lt;br&gt; I’m lucky, I know&lt;br&gt; But I wanna go home&lt;br&gt; Mmmm, I’ve got to go home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let me go home&lt;br&gt; I’m just too far from where you are&lt;br&gt; I wanna come home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I feel just like I’m living someone else’s life&lt;br&gt; It’s like I just stepped outside&lt;br&gt; When everything was going right&lt;br&gt; And I know just why you could not&lt;br&gt; Come along with me&lt;br&gt; 'Cause this was not your dream&lt;br&gt; But you always believed in me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Another winter day has come&lt;br&gt; And gone away&lt;br&gt; In even Paris and Rome&lt;br&gt; And I wanna go home&lt;br&gt; Let me go home&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I’m surrounded by&lt;br&gt; A million people I&lt;br&gt; Still feel all alone&lt;br&gt; Oh, let me go home&lt;br&gt; Oh, I miss you, you know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let me go home&lt;br&gt; I’ve had my run&lt;br&gt; Baby, I’m done&lt;br&gt; I gotta go home&lt;br&gt; Let me go home&lt;br&gt; It will all be all right&lt;br&gt; I’ll be home tonight&lt;br&gt; I’m coming back home</Lyrics>

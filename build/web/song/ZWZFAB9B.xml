    <Lyrics>I should have known all along, there was something wrong&lt;br&gt; I just never read between the lines&lt;br&gt; Then I woke up one day and found you on your way&lt;br&gt; Leaving nothing but my heart behind&lt;br&gt; What can I do to make it up to you&lt;br&gt; Promises don't come easy&lt;br&gt; But tell me if there's a way to bring you back home to stay&lt;br&gt; Well I'd promises anything to you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've been walkin' around with my head hanging down&lt;br&gt; Wondrin' what I'm gonna do&lt;br&gt; 'Cause when you walked out that door, I knew I needed you more&lt;br&gt; Than to take a chance on losing you&lt;br&gt; What can I do to make it up to you&lt;br&gt; Promises don't come easy&lt;br&gt; You know I've made up my mind to make it work this time&lt;br&gt; That's the promise that I give to you&lt;br&gt; You never thought I loved you&lt;br&gt; I guess you never thought I cared&lt;br&gt; I was just too proud to say it out loud&lt;br&gt; Now I know, to let my feelings go (so tell me)&lt;br&gt; What can I do to make it up to you&lt;br&gt; Promises don't come easy&lt;br&gt; You know I've made up my mind to make it work this time&lt;br&gt; That's the promise I can give to you&lt;br&gt; What can I do to make it up to you</Lyrics>

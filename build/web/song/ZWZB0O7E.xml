    <Lyrics>Staring out at the rain with a heavy heart&lt;br&gt; It's the end of the world in my mind&lt;br&gt; Then your voice pulls me back like a wake up call&lt;br&gt; I've been looking for the answer&lt;br&gt; Somewhere&lt;br&gt; I couldn't see that it was right there&lt;br&gt; But now I know what I didn't know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because you live and breathe&lt;br&gt; Because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help&lt;br&gt; Because you live, girl&lt;br&gt; My world has twice as many stars in the sky&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's alright, I survived, I'm alive again&lt;br&gt; Cuz of you, made it through every storm&lt;br&gt; What is life, what's the use if you're killing time&lt;br&gt; I'm so glad I found an angel&lt;br&gt; Someone&lt;br&gt; Who was there when all my hopes fell&lt;br&gt; I wanna fly, looking in your eyes&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because you live and breathe&lt;br&gt; Because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help&lt;br&gt; Because you live, girl&lt;br&gt; My world has twice as many stars in the sky&lt;br&gt; Because you live, I live&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because you live there's a reason why&lt;br&gt; I carry on when I lose the fight&lt;br&gt; I want to give what you've given me always&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because you live and breathe&lt;br&gt; Because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help&lt;br&gt; Because you live, girl&lt;br&gt; My world has twice as many stars in the sky&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because you live and breathe&lt;br&gt; Because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help&lt;br&gt; Because you live, girl&lt;br&gt; My world has everything I need to survive&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Because you live, I live, I live</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&quot;Invisible&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Crowded hallways are the loneliest places&lt;br&gt; For outcasts and rebels&lt;br&gt; Or anyone who just dares to be different&lt;br&gt; And you've been trying for so long&lt;br&gt; To find out where your place is&lt;br&gt; But in their narrow minds&lt;br&gt; There's no room for anyone who dares to do something different&lt;br&gt; Oh, but listen for a minute&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Trust the one&lt;br&gt; Who's been where you are wishing all it was&lt;br&gt; Was sticks and stones&lt;br&gt; Those words cut deep but they don't mean you're all alone&lt;br&gt; And you're not invisible&lt;br&gt; Hear me out,&lt;br&gt; There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now&lt;br&gt; Someday you'll look back on all these days&lt;br&gt; And all this pain is gonna be invisible&lt;br&gt; Oh, invisible&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So your confidence is quiet&lt;br&gt; To them quiet looks like weakness&lt;br&gt; But you don't have to fight it&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you're strong enough to win without a war&lt;br&gt; Every heart has a rhythm&lt;br&gt; Let yours beat out so loudly&lt;br&gt; That everyone can hear it&lt;br&gt; Yeah, I promise you don't need to hide it anymore&lt;br&gt; Oh, and never be afraid of doing something different&lt;br&gt; Dare to be something more&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Trust the one&lt;br&gt; Who's been where you are wishing all it was&lt;br&gt; Was sticks and stones&lt;br&gt; Yeah, the words cut deep but they don't mean you're all alone&lt;br&gt; And you're not invisible&lt;br&gt; Hear me out,&lt;br&gt; There's so much more of this life than what you're feeling now&lt;br&gt; And someday you'll look back on all these days&lt;br&gt; And all this pain is gonna be invisible&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; These labels that they give you&lt;br&gt; just 'cause they don't understand&lt;br&gt; If you look past this moment&lt;br&gt; You'll see you've got a friend&lt;br&gt; Waving a flag for who you are&lt;br&gt; And all you're gonna do&lt;br&gt; Yeah, so here's to you&lt;br&gt; And here's to anyone who's ever felt invisible&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Yeah, and you're not invisible&lt;br&gt; Hear me out,&lt;br&gt; There's so much more to life than what you're feeling now&lt;br&gt; And someday you'll look back on all these days&lt;br&gt; And all this pain is gonna be invisible&lt;br&gt; It'll be invisible</Lyrics>

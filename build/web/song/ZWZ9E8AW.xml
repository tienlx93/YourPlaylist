    <Lyrics>Come up to meet you &lt;br&gt; Tell you I'm sorry&lt;br&gt; You don't know how lovely you are&lt;br&gt; I had to find you&lt;br&gt; Tell you I need you&lt;br&gt; Tell you I set you apart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Tell me your secrets&lt;br&gt; And ask me your questions&lt;br&gt; Oh let's go back to the start&lt;br&gt; Running in circles; coming up tails&lt;br&gt; Heads on a silence apart &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Nobody said it was easy&lt;br&gt; It's such a shame for us to part&lt;br&gt; Nobody said it was easy&lt;br&gt; No one ever said it would be this hard&lt;br&gt; Oh take me back to the start&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I was just guessing at numbers and figures&lt;br&gt; Pulling your puzzles apart&lt;br&gt; Questions of science; science and progress&lt;br&gt; Do not speak as loud as my heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Tell me you love me&lt;br&gt; Come back and haunt me&lt;br&gt; Oh and I rush to the start&lt;br&gt; Running in circles, chasing our tails&lt;br&gt; Coming back as we are&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Nobody said it was easy&lt;br&gt; Oh it's such a shame for us to part&lt;br&gt; Nobody said it was easy&lt;br&gt; No one ever said it would be so hard&lt;br&gt; I'm going back to the start&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>You're the light, you're the night&lt;br&gt; You're the color of my blood&lt;br&gt; You're the cure, you're the pain&lt;br&gt; You're the only thing I wanna touch&lt;br&gt; Never knew that it could mean so much, so much&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You're the feel, I don't care&lt;br&gt; Cause I've never been so high&lt;br&gt; Follow me to the dark&lt;br&gt; Let me take you past our satellites&lt;br&gt; You can see the world you brought to life, to life&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So love me like you do, love me like you do&lt;br&gt; Love me like you do, love me like you do&lt;br&gt; Touch me like you do, touch me like you do&lt;br&gt; What are you waiting for?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Fading in, fading out&lt;br&gt; On the edge of paradise&lt;br&gt; Every inch of your skin is a holy gray I've got to find&lt;br&gt; Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire&lt;br&gt; Yeah, I'll let you set the pace&lt;br&gt; Cause I'm not thinking straight&lt;br&gt; My head spinning around I can't see clear no more&lt;br&gt; What are you waiting for?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Love me like you do, love me like you do&lt;br&gt; Love me like you do, love me like you do&lt;br&gt; Touch me like you do, touch me like you do&lt;br&gt; What are you waiting for?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Love me like you do, love me like you do&lt;br&gt; Love me like you do, love me like you do&lt;br&gt; Touch me like you do, touch me like you do&lt;br&gt; What are you waiting for?</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Misery&lt;br&gt; Oh yeah&lt;br&gt; Oh yeah&lt;br&gt; So scared of breaking it&lt;br&gt; But you won't let it bend&lt;br&gt; And I wrote two hundred letters&lt;br&gt; I will never send&lt;br&gt; Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem&lt;br&gt; You'd rather cover up&lt;br&gt; I'd rather let them bleed&lt;br&gt; So let me be&lt;br&gt; And I'll set you free&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; I am in misery&lt;br&gt; There ain't nobody who can comfort me&lt;br&gt; (Oh yeah)&lt;br&gt; Why won't you answer me&lt;br&gt; The silence is slowly killing me&lt;br&gt; Girl you really got me bad&lt;br&gt; You really got me bad&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna get you back&lt;br&gt; Gonna get you back&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Your salty skin and how&lt;br&gt; It mixes in with mine&lt;br&gt; The way it feels to be&lt;br&gt; Completely intertwined&lt;br&gt; Not that I didn't care&lt;br&gt; It's that I didn't know&lt;br&gt; It's not what I didn't feel,&lt;br&gt; It's what I didn't show&lt;br&gt; So let me be&lt;br&gt; And I'll set you free&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I am in misery&lt;br&gt; There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)&lt;br&gt; Why won't you answer me&lt;br&gt; The silence is slowly killing me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Girl you really got me bad&lt;br&gt; You really got me bad&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna get you back&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna get you back&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Say your faith is shaken&lt;br&gt; You may be mistaken&lt;br&gt; You keep me wide awake and&lt;br&gt; Waiting for the sun&lt;br&gt; I'm desperate and confused&lt;br&gt; So far away from you&lt;br&gt; I'm getting there&lt;br&gt; I don't care where I have to go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Why do you do what you do to me, yeah&lt;br&gt; Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah&lt;br&gt; Why do you do what you do to me, yeah&lt;br&gt; Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I am in misery&lt;br&gt; There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)&lt;br&gt; Why won't you answer me&lt;br&gt; The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [x3]&lt;br&gt; Girl you really got me bad&lt;br&gt; You really got me bad&lt;br&gt; I'm gonna get you back&lt;br&gt; Gonna get you back</Lyrics>

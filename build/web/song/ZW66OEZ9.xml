    <Lyrics>All I hear is raindrops falling on the rooftop&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh baby, tell me why'd you have to go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 'Cause this pain I feel it won't go away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And today I'm officially missin' you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I thought that from this heartache, I could escape&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I've fronted long enough to know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There ain't no way&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And today I'm officially missing you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ooh... can't nobody do it like you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Said every little thing you do, hey baby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Said it stays on my mind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I-I'm officially missin' you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; All I do is lay aroun, 2 years full of tears&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; From looking at your face on the wall&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just a week ago you were my baby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now I don't even know you at all, I don't know you at all&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well, I wish that you would call me right now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So that I could get through to you somehow&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I guess it's safe to say, baby, safe to say&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; that I-I'm officially missin' you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ooh... can't nobody do it like you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Said every little thing you do, hey baby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Said it stays on my mind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I-I'm officially...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well, I thought I could just get over you, baby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I see there's something I just can't do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; From the way you would hold me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To the sweet things you told me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I just can't find a way to let go of you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ooh... can't nobody do it like you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Said every little thing you do, hey baby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Said it stays on my mind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And I-I'm officially missing you</Lyrics>

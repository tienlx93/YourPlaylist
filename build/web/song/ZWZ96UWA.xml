    <Lyrics>I always needed time on my own&lt;br&gt; I never thought I'd need you there when I cry&lt;br&gt; And the days feel like years when I'm alone&lt;br&gt; And the bed where you lie is made up on your side&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When you walk away I count the steps that you take&lt;br&gt; Do you see how much I need you right now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; When you're gone&lt;br&gt; The pieces of my heart are missing you&lt;br&gt; When you're gone&lt;br&gt; The face I came to know is missing too&lt;br&gt; When you're gone&lt;br&gt; The words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it ok&lt;br&gt; I miss you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've never felt this way before&lt;br&gt; Everything that I do reminds me of you&lt;br&gt; And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor&lt;br&gt; And they smell just like you, I love the things that you do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When you walk away I count the steps that you take&lt;br&gt; Do you see how much I need you right now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We were made for each other&lt;br&gt; Out here forever&lt;br&gt; I know we were, yeah&lt;br&gt; All I ever wanted was for you to know&lt;br&gt; Everything I'd do, I'd give my heart and soul&lt;br&gt; I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me, yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]</Lyrics>

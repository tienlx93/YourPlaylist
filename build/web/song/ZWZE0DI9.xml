    <Lyrics>&lt;br&gt; I would bet my life, like I bet my heart&lt;br&gt; That you were the one, baby&lt;br&gt; I've never been so sure, of anything before&lt;br&gt; It's driving my heart crazy&lt;br&gt; I can't hold out, I can't hold back now&lt;br&gt; Like I've done before&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Darlin, look at me, I've fallen like a fool for you&lt;br&gt; And Darlin can't you see, I'd do anything you want me to&lt;br&gt; I tell myself, I'm in too deep&lt;br&gt; Then I fall a little farther&lt;br&gt; Every time you look at me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; How do you do that girl?&lt;br&gt; Make me feel like I'm, the only man alive for you&lt;br&gt; I guess that's what it is, that makes me fall like this&lt;br&gt; The first time in your arms I knew&lt;br&gt; The way you held me, it overwhelmed me&lt;br&gt; I went out of my mind&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Darlin, look at me, I've fallen like a fool for you&lt;br&gt; And Darlin can't you see, I'd do anything you want me to&lt;br&gt; I tell myself, I'm in too deep&lt;br&gt; Then I fall a little farther&lt;br&gt; Every time you look at me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Every time, baby&lt;br&gt; Every time you look at me&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&quot;Until You&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let's just take our time &lt;br&gt; Theres nothing else to do &lt;br&gt; What better way to spend the night &lt;br&gt; Wasting it with you &lt;br&gt; The moon has won the war &lt;br&gt; The daylight waits to win &lt;br&gt; Stay here by my side &lt;br&gt; We'll watch the struggle start again &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I need you &lt;br&gt; Now and forever &lt;br&gt; To stay right here with me &lt;br&gt; Don't ever leave &lt;br&gt; Love was kept &lt;br&gt; From me like a secret &lt;br&gt; And I swore I was through &lt;br&gt; Until you &lt;br&gt; Until you &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The city's settled down &lt;br&gt; I watch you as you sleep &lt;br&gt; There's a silent celebration &lt;br&gt; For every breath you breathe &lt;br&gt; All this now makes sense &lt;br&gt; With you as company &lt;br&gt; I left all I knew and found &lt;br&gt; The better part of me &lt;br&gt; Yeah yeah &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I need you &lt;br&gt; Now and forever &lt;br&gt; To stay right here with me &lt;br&gt; Don't ever leave &lt;br&gt; Love was kept &lt;br&gt; From me like a secret &lt;br&gt; And I swore I was through &lt;br&gt; Until you &lt;br&gt; Until you &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The time it took to find you &lt;br&gt; I would wait again, my baby &lt;br&gt; For the feelings that I feel with you now &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I need you &lt;br&gt; Now and forever &lt;br&gt; To stay right here with me &lt;br&gt; Don't ever leave &lt;br&gt; Love was kept &lt;br&gt; From me like a secret &lt;br&gt; And I swore I was through &lt;br&gt; Until you &lt;br&gt; Until you &lt;br&gt; Until you &lt;br&gt; Until you &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

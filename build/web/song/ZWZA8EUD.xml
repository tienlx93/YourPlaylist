    <Lyrics>I asked her to stay but she wouldn't listen&lt;br&gt; She left before I had the chance to say&lt;br&gt; Oh&lt;br&gt; The words that would mend the things that were broken&lt;br&gt; But now it's far too late, she's gone away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Every night you cry yourself to sleep&lt;br&gt; Thinking: &quot;Why does this happen to me?&lt;br&gt; Why does every moment have to be so hard?&quot;&lt;br&gt; Hard to believe that&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's not over tonight&lt;br&gt; Just give me one more chance to make it right&lt;br&gt; I may not make it through the night&lt;br&gt; I won't go home without you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The taste of your breath, I'll never get over&lt;br&gt; The noises that she made kept me awake&lt;br&gt; Oh&lt;br&gt; The weight of things that remained unspoken&lt;br&gt; Built up so much it crushed us everyday&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Every night you cry yourself to sleep&lt;br&gt; Thinking: &quot;Why does this happen to me?&lt;br&gt; Why does every moment have to be so hard?&quot;&lt;br&gt; Hard to believe that&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's not over tonight&lt;br&gt; Just give me one more chance to make it right&lt;br&gt; I may not make it through the night&lt;br&gt; I won't go home without you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's not over tonight&lt;br&gt; Just give me one more chance to make it right&lt;br&gt; I may not make it through the night&lt;br&gt; I won't go home without you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Of all the things I felt but never really shown&lt;br&gt; Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go&lt;br&gt; I should not ever let you go, oh oh oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's not over tonight&lt;br&gt; Just give me one more chance to make it right&lt;br&gt; I may not make it through the night&lt;br&gt; I won't go home without you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's not over tonight&lt;br&gt; Just give me one more chance to make it right&lt;br&gt; I may not make it through the night&lt;br&gt; I won't go home without you&lt;br&gt; And I won't go home without you&lt;br&gt; And I won't go home without you&lt;br&gt; And I won't go home without you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

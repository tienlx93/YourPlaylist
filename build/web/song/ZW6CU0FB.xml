    <Lyrics>I miss the days to the sweet lie&lt;br&gt; I miss the conversation&lt;br&gt; I’m such a fool of song tonight&lt;br&gt; I’m changing all of the stations&lt;br&gt; I like to think through, we had it all&lt;br&gt; We drove 'em out to 'em better days&lt;br&gt; But I’m not running I’m super fun&lt;br&gt; Oh baby why did you run away?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I was there for you&lt;br&gt; In your darkest times&lt;br&gt; I was there for you&lt;br&gt; In your darkest nights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I wonder where were you&lt;br&gt; When I was at my worst&lt;br&gt; Down on my knees&lt;br&gt; And instead of my having back&lt;br&gt; So I wonder where were you&lt;br&gt; All the worse you took came back to me&lt;br&gt; So I’m following the map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; And nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; And nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I hear your voice at my sleeping night&lt;br&gt; Hard to resist temptation&lt;br&gt; Cause all the strangers come over me&lt;br&gt; Now I can’t get over you&lt;br&gt; No I just can’t get over you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I was there for you&lt;br&gt; In your darkest times&lt;br&gt; I was there for you&lt;br&gt; In your darkest nights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I wonder where were you&lt;br&gt; When I was at my worst&lt;br&gt; Down on my knees&lt;br&gt; And instead of my having back&lt;br&gt; So I wonder where were you&lt;br&gt; All the worse you took came back to me&lt;br&gt; So I’m following the map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; And nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; And nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh&lt;br&gt; Yeah yeah&lt;br&gt; Oh oh&lt;br&gt; Oh oh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh I was there for you&lt;br&gt; Oh In you darkest times&lt;br&gt; Oh I was there for you&lt;br&gt; Oh In your darkest nights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh I was there for you&lt;br&gt; Oh In you darkest times&lt;br&gt; Oh I was there for you&lt;br&gt; Oh In your darkest nights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But I wonder where were you&lt;br&gt; When I was at my worst&lt;br&gt; Down on my knees&lt;br&gt; And instead of my having back&lt;br&gt; So I wonder where were you&lt;br&gt; All the worse you took came back to me&lt;br&gt; So I’m following the map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; And nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following to you&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; And nothing I can do&lt;br&gt; The map that leads to you&lt;br&gt; Following, following, following</Lyrics>

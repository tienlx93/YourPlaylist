    <Lyrics>You know the bed feels warmer&lt;br&gt; Sleeping here alone&lt;br&gt; You know I dream in colour&lt;br&gt; And do the things I want&lt;br&gt; You think you got the best of me&lt;br&gt; Think you had the last laugh&lt;br&gt; Bet you think that everything good is gone&lt;br&gt; Think you left me broken down&lt;br&gt; Think that I'd come running back&lt;br&gt; Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes you stronger&lt;br&gt; Stand a little taller&lt;br&gt; Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes a fighter&lt;br&gt; Footsteps even lighter&lt;br&gt; Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger&lt;br&gt; Just me, myself and I&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes you stronger&lt;br&gt; Stand a little taller&lt;br&gt; Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone&lt;br&gt; You heard that I was starting over with someone new&lt;br&gt; But told you I was moving on over you&lt;br&gt; You didn't think that I'd come back&lt;br&gt; I'd come back swinging&lt;br&gt; You tried to break me, but you see&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes you stronger&lt;br&gt; Stand a little taller&lt;br&gt; Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes a fighter&lt;br&gt; Footsteps even lighter&lt;br&gt; Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger&lt;br&gt; Just me, myself and I&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes you stronger&lt;br&gt; Stand a little taller&lt;br&gt; Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone&lt;br&gt; Thanks to you I got a new thing started&lt;br&gt; Thanks to you I'm not a broken hearted&lt;br&gt; Thanks to you I'm finally thinking bout me&lt;br&gt; You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning&lt;br&gt; In the end...&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes you stronger&lt;br&gt; Stand a little taller&lt;br&gt; Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes a fighter&lt;br&gt; Footsteps even lighter&lt;br&gt; Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger&lt;br&gt; Just me, myself and I&lt;br&gt; What doesn't kill you makes you stronger&lt;br&gt; Stand a little taller&lt;br&gt; Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone</Lyrics>

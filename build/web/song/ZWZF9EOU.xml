    <Lyrics>I gave up the fight for love&lt;br&gt; Walked away to come for gloves&lt;br&gt; No more wishing on a star&lt;br&gt; Waiting for someone&lt;br&gt; What if no one ever comes&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself&lt;br&gt; Oh, I never felt nothing better&lt;br&gt; Baby how could I know you'd come rushing down from Heaven&lt;br&gt; Now my heart is open forever&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't have to sleep to dream&lt;br&gt; I can hardly believe what I see&lt;br&gt; When you stand before me&lt;br&gt; You're everything I never thought&lt;br&gt; That I would ever find&lt;br&gt; Now I don't have to sleep to dream&lt;br&gt; You're a dream to me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There's a cure for bleeding heart&lt;br&gt; Think you showed me where to start&lt;br&gt; Everytime I lose my grip&lt;br&gt; You keep me hangin' on&lt;br&gt; You remind that I'm strong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself&lt;br&gt; Oh, I never felt nothing better&lt;br&gt; Baby how could I know you'd come rushing down from Heaven&lt;br&gt; Now my heart is open forever&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't have to sleep to dream&lt;br&gt; I can hardly believe what I see&lt;br&gt; When you stand before me&lt;br&gt; You're everything I never thought&lt;br&gt; That I would ever found&lt;br&gt; Now I don't have to sleep to dream&lt;br&gt; You're a dream&lt;br&gt; I don't have to sleep to dream&lt;br&gt; I can hardly believe what I see&lt;br&gt; When you stand before me&lt;br&gt; You're everything I never thought&lt;br&gt; That I would ever find&lt;br&gt; Now I don't have to sleep to dream&lt;br&gt; You're a dream to me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You're a dream&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I don't have to sleep to dream&lt;br&gt; I can hardly believe what I see&lt;br&gt; When you stand before me&lt;br&gt; You're everything I never thought&lt;br&gt; That I would ever find&lt;br&gt; Now I don't have to sleep to dream&lt;br&gt; You're a dream&lt;br&gt; You're a dream to me</Lyrics>

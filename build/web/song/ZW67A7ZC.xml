    <Lyrics>I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath&lt;br&gt; Scared to rock the boat and make a mess&lt;br&gt; So I sat quietly, agreed politely&lt;br&gt; I guess that I forgot I had a choice&lt;br&gt; I let you push me past the breaking point&lt;br&gt; I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You held me down, but I got up&lt;br&gt; Already brushing off the dust&lt;br&gt; You hear my voice, your hear that sound&lt;br&gt; Like thunder, gonna shake your ground&lt;br&gt; You held me down, but I got up&lt;br&gt; Get ready cause I’ve had enough&lt;br&gt; I see it all, I see it now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire&lt;br&gt; Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR&lt;br&gt; Louder, louder than a lion&lt;br&gt; Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR&lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh oh oh oh&lt;br&gt; You’re gonna hear me roar&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now I’m floating like a butterfly&lt;br&gt; Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes&lt;br&gt; I went from zero, to my own hero&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You held me down, but I got up&lt;br&gt; Already brushing off the dust&lt;br&gt; You hear my voice, your hear that sound&lt;br&gt; Like thunder, gonna shake your ground&lt;br&gt; You held me down, but I got up&lt;br&gt; Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough&lt;br&gt; I see it all, I see it now&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire&lt;br&gt; ‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR&lt;br&gt; Louder, louder than a lion&lt;br&gt; ‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR&lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh oh oh oh&lt;br&gt; You’re gonna hear me roar&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire&lt;br&gt; ‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR&lt;br&gt; Louder, louder than a lion&lt;br&gt; ‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR&lt;br&gt; Oh oh oh oh oh oh&lt;br&gt; You’re gonna hear me roar</Lyrics>

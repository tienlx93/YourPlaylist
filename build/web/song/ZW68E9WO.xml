    <Lyrics>Lyrics&lt;br&gt; [Hook: Rihanna]&lt;br&gt; I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed&lt;br&gt; Get along with the voices inside of my head&lt;br&gt; You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath&lt;br&gt; And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 1: Eminem]&lt;br&gt; I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek&lt;br&gt; Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey&lt;br&gt; Wanted to receive attention for my music&lt;br&gt; Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me&lt;br&gt; Been wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways&lt;br&gt; Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated&lt;br&gt; When I blew; see, it was confusing&lt;br&gt; Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf&lt;br&gt; Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)&lt;br&gt; Hit the lottery, oh wee&lt;br&gt; With what I gave up to get was bittersweet&lt;br&gt; It was like winning a huge meet&lt;br&gt; Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink&lt;br&gt; I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep&lt;br&gt; Going cucko and cooky as Kool Keith&lt;br&gt; But I'm actually weirder than you think&lt;br&gt; Cause I'm&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge: Rihanna]&lt;br&gt; Well, that's not fair&lt;br&gt; Well, that's not fair&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2: Eminem]&lt;br&gt; Now I ain't much of a poet&lt;br&gt; But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it&lt;br&gt; Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow so I keep conjuring&lt;br&gt; Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from&lt;br&gt; (Yeah, ponder it&lt;br&gt; You-you won there's no more u-u-using your mind&lt;br&gt; The way it worked)&lt;br&gt; Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo&lt;br&gt; I think you've been wandering off down yonder&lt;br&gt; And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen&lt;br&gt; Cause I need an interventionist&lt;br&gt; To intervene between me and this monster&lt;br&gt; And save me from myself and all this conflict&lt;br&gt; Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it&lt;br&gt; My OCD is conking me in the head&lt;br&gt; Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking&lt;br&gt; I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying&lt;br&gt; Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 3: Eminem]&lt;br&gt; Call me crazy, but I had this vision&lt;br&gt; One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian&lt;br&gt; But until then drums get killed I'm coming straight at&lt;br&gt; Emcees, blood get spilled and I&lt;br&gt; Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track&lt;br&gt; Give every kid who got played that&lt;br&gt; Pumped the villian and shit that say back&lt;br&gt; To the kids who played 'em&lt;br&gt; I ain't here to save the fucking children&lt;br&gt; But if one kid out of a hundred million&lt;br&gt; Who are going through a struggle feels and relates that's great&lt;br&gt; It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back&lt;br&gt; In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that&lt;br&gt; Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack&lt;br&gt; Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts&lt;br&gt; I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that&lt;br&gt; It's nothing, I'm still friends with the</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&lt;br&gt; You look in my eyes&lt;br&gt; And I get emotional inside&lt;br&gt; I know it's crazy&lt;br&gt; But you still can touch my heart&lt;br&gt; And after all this time&lt;br&gt; You'd think that I&lt;br&gt; I wouldn't feel the same&lt;br&gt; But time melts into nothing&lt;br&gt; And nothing's changed&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; I still believe&lt;br&gt; Someday you and me&lt;br&gt; Will find ourselves in love again&lt;br&gt; I had a dream&lt;br&gt; Someday you and me&lt;br&gt; Will find ourselves in love again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Each day of my life&lt;br&gt; I'm filled with all the joy I could find&lt;br&gt; You know that I&lt;br&gt; I'm not the desperate type&lt;br&gt; If there's one spark of hope&lt;br&gt; Left in my grasp&lt;br&gt; I'll hold it with both hands&lt;br&gt; It's worth the risk of burning&lt;br&gt; To have a second chance&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no I need you baby&lt;br&gt; I still believe that we can be together&lt;br&gt; If we believe that true love never has to end&lt;br&gt; Then we must know that we will love again.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]</Lyrics>

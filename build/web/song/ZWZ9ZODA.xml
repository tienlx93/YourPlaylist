    <Lyrics>You were standing in the wake of devastation,&lt;br&gt; And you were waiting on the edge of the unknown.&lt;br&gt; And with the cataclysm raining down,&lt;br&gt; Insides crying, &quot;Save me now&quot;,&lt;br&gt; You were there, impossibly alone.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?&lt;br&gt; You build up all the failure's all you've known.&lt;br&gt; Remember all the sadness and frustration,&lt;br&gt; And let it go,&lt;br&gt; Let it go.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And in a burst of light that blinded every angel,&lt;br&gt; As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars,&lt;br&gt; You felt the gravity of tempered grace,&lt;br&gt; Falling into empty space,&lt;br&gt; No one there to catch you in their arms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?&lt;br&gt; You build up all the failure's all you've known.&lt;br&gt; Remember all the sadness and frustration,&lt;br&gt; And let it go,&lt;br&gt; Let it go.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?&lt;br&gt; You build up all the failure's all you've known.&lt;br&gt; Remember all the sadness and frustration,&lt;br&gt; And let it go,&lt;br&gt; Let it go.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Let it go,&lt;br&gt; Let it go,&lt;br&gt; Let it go.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?&lt;br&gt; You build up all the failure's all you've known.&lt;br&gt; Remember all the sadness and frustration,&lt;br&gt; And let it go,&lt;br&gt; Let it go.</Lyrics>

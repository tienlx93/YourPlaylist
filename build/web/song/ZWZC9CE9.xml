    <Lyrics>I'm sitting here in a boring room&lt;br&gt; It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon&lt;br&gt; I'm wasting my time I got nothing to do&lt;br&gt; I'm hanging around I'm waiting for you&lt;br&gt; But nothing ever happens - and I wonder&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm driving around in my car&lt;br&gt; I'm driving too fast I'm driving too far&lt;br&gt; I'd like to change my point of view&lt;br&gt; I feel so lonely I'm waiting for you&lt;br&gt; But nothing ever happens - and I wonder&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; *I wonder how I wonder why&lt;br&gt; Yesterday you told me 'bout a blue blue sky&lt;br&gt; And all that I can see&lt;br&gt; It's just a yellow lemon tree&lt;br&gt; Lemon tree&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm turning my head up and down&lt;br&gt; I'm turning turning turning turning&lt;br&gt; turning around&lt;br&gt; And all that I can see&lt;br&gt; It's just another yellow lemon tree*&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm sitting here I miss there power&lt;br&gt; I'd like to go out taking a shower&lt;br&gt; But there's a heavy cloud inside my head&lt;br&gt; I feel so tired put myself into bed&lt;br&gt; Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Isolation - is not good for me&lt;br&gt; Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree&lt;br&gt; I'm stepping around in a desert of joy&lt;br&gt; Baby anyhow&lt;br&gt; I'll get another toy and everything will&lt;br&gt; happen and you'll wonder</Lyrics>

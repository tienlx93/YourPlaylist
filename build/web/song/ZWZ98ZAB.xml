    <Lyrics>Sunday morning rain is falling&lt;br&gt; Steal some covers share some skin&lt;br&gt; Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable&lt;br&gt; You twist to fit the mold that I am in&lt;br&gt; But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do&lt;br&gt; And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew&lt;br&gt; That someday it would lead me back to you&lt;br&gt; That someday it would lead me back to you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; That may be all I need&lt;br&gt; In darkness she is all I see&lt;br&gt; Come and rest your bones with me&lt;br&gt; Driving slow on Sunday morning&lt;br&gt; And I never want to leave&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Fingers trace your every outline&lt;br&gt; Paint a picture with my hands&lt;br&gt; Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm&lt;br&gt; Change the weather still together when it ends&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; That may be all I need&lt;br&gt; In darkness she is all I see&lt;br&gt; Come and rest your bones with me&lt;br&gt; Driving slow on Sunday morning&lt;br&gt; And I never want to leave&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do&lt;br&gt; Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you&lt;br&gt; Singing someday it'll bring me back to you&lt;br&gt; Find a way to bring myself back home to you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And you may not know&lt;br&gt; That may be all I need&lt;br&gt; In darkness she is all I see&lt;br&gt; Come and rest your bones with me&lt;br&gt; Driving slow on Sunday morning&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

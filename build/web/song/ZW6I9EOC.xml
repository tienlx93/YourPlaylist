    <Lyrics>Dry lightning cracks across the skies&lt;br&gt; Those storm clouds gather in her eyes&lt;br&gt; Her daddy was mean old mister&lt;br&gt; Mama was an angel in the ground&lt;br&gt; The weather man called for a twister&lt;br&gt; She prayed blow it down&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &quot;There's not enough rain in Oklahoma&lt;br&gt; To wash the sins out of that house&lt;br&gt; There's not enough wind in Oklahoma&lt;br&gt; To rip the nails out of the past&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Shatter every window till it's all blown away&lt;br&gt; Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away&lt;br&gt; Till there's nothing left standing&lt;br&gt; Nothing left of yesterday&lt;br&gt; Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away&lt;br&gt; BLOWN AWAY&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; She heard those sirens screaming out&lt;br&gt; Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch&lt;br&gt; She locked herself in the cellar&lt;br&gt; Listen to screaming of the wind&lt;br&gt; Some people called it taking shelter&lt;br&gt; She called it sweet revenge&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Shatter every window till it's all blown away&lt;br&gt; Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away&lt;br&gt; Till there's nothing left standing&lt;br&gt; Nothing left of yesterday&lt;br&gt; Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away&lt;br&gt; BLOWN AWAY&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &quot;There's not enough rain in Oklahoma&lt;br&gt; To wash the sins out of that house&lt;br&gt; There's not enough wind in Oklahoma&lt;br&gt; To rip the nails out of the past&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Shatter every window till it’s all blown away (blown away)&lt;br&gt; Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away (blown away)&lt;br&gt; Till there’s nothing left standing,&lt;br&gt; Nothing left of yesterday (blown away)&lt;br&gt; Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away</Lyrics>

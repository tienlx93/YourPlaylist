    <Lyrics>&quot;Jingle Bells&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh &lt;br&gt; O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way; &lt;br&gt; Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright &lt;br&gt; What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! &lt;br&gt; O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh &lt;br&gt; Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! &lt;br&gt; O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride &lt;br&gt; And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side; &lt;br&gt; The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot; &lt;br&gt; We ran into a drifted bank and there we got upset &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! &lt;br&gt; O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh &lt;br&gt; Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! &lt;br&gt; O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! &lt;br&gt; O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh &lt;br&gt; Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! &lt;br&gt; O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In a one-horse open sleigh... &lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>Remembering me, discover and see,&lt;br&gt; All over the world, she's known as a girl,&lt;br&gt; To those who are free, their minds shall be keep,&lt;br&gt; Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; God is a girl, wherever you are,&lt;br&gt; Do you believe it, can you receive it,&lt;br&gt; God is a girl, whatever you say,&lt;br&gt; Do you believe it, can you receive it,&lt;br&gt; God is a girl, however you live,&lt;br&gt; Do you believe it, can you receive it,&lt;br&gt; God is a girl, she's only a girl,&lt;br&gt; Do you believe it, can you receive it?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; She wants to shine, forever in time,&lt;br&gt; She is so driven, she's always mine,&lt;br&gt; Clearly and free, she wants you to be,&lt;br&gt; A part of the future, a girl like me,&lt;br&gt; There is a sky, eluminating us,&lt;br&gt; Someone is out there, that we truly trust,&lt;br&gt; There is a rainbow, for you and me,&lt;br&gt; A beautiful sunrise, eternally.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; God is a girl, wherever you are,&lt;br&gt; Do you believe it, can you receive it,&lt;br&gt; God is a girl, whatever you say,&lt;br&gt; Do you believe it, can you receive it,&lt;br&gt; God is a girl, however you live,&lt;br&gt; Do you believe it, can you receive it,&lt;br&gt; God is a girl, she's only a girl,&lt;br&gt; Do you believe it, can you receive it?</Lyrics>

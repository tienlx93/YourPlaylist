    <Lyrics>Whooo umm yeah...&lt;br&gt; Life's like a road that you travel on&lt;br&gt; When there's one day here and the next day gone&lt;br&gt; Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand&lt;br&gt; Sometimes you turn your back to the wind&lt;br&gt; There's a world outside ev'ry darkened door&lt;br&gt; Where blues won't haunt you anymore&lt;br&gt; Where brave are free and lovers soar&lt;br&gt; Come ride with me to the distant shore&lt;br&gt; We won't hesitate&lt;br&gt; To break down the garden gate&lt;br&gt; There's not much time left today&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus:]&lt;br&gt; Life is a highway&lt;br&gt; I wanna ride it all night long&lt;br&gt; If you're going my way&lt;br&gt; I wanna drive it all night long&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Through all these cities and all these towns&lt;br&gt; It's in my blood and it's all around&lt;br&gt; I love you now like I loved you then&lt;br&gt; This is the road and these are the hands&lt;br&gt; From Mozambique to those Memphis nights&lt;br&gt; The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Knock me down get back up again&lt;br&gt; You're in my blood&lt;br&gt; I'm not a lonely man&lt;br&gt; There's no load I can't hold&lt;br&gt; Road so rough this I know&lt;br&gt; I'll be there when the light comes in&lt;br&gt; Just tell 'em we're survivors&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)&lt;br&gt; A misunderstanding once&lt;br&gt; But now we look it in the eye&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ooooo...Yeah!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There ain't no load that I can't hold&lt;br&gt; Road so rough this I know&lt;br&gt; I'll be there when the light comes in&lt;br&gt; Just tell 'em we're survivors&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus: (x3)]&lt;br&gt; Life is a highway&lt;br&gt; I wanna ride it all night long&lt;br&gt; If you're going my way&lt;br&gt; I wanna drive it all night long&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I was so high I did not recognize&lt;br&gt; The fire burning in her eyes&lt;br&gt; The chaos that controlled my mind&lt;br&gt; Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane&lt;br&gt; Never to return again&lt;br&gt; But always in my heart&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This love has taken its toll on me&lt;br&gt; She said Goodbye too many times before&lt;br&gt; And her heart is breaking in front of me&lt;br&gt; I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I tried my best to feed her appetite&lt;br&gt; Keep her coming every night&lt;br&gt; So hard to keep her satisfied&lt;br&gt; Kept playing love like it was just a game&lt;br&gt; Pretending to feel the same&lt;br&gt; Then turn around and leave again&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This love has taken its toll on me&lt;br&gt; She said Goodbye too many times before&lt;br&gt; And her heart is breaking in front of me&lt;br&gt; I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll fix these broken things&lt;br&gt; Repair your broken wings&lt;br&gt; And make sure everything's alright&lt;br&gt; My pressure on your hips&lt;br&gt; Sinking my fingertips&lt;br&gt; Into every inch of you&lt;br&gt; Cause I know that's what you want me to do&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This love has taken its toll on me&lt;br&gt; She said Goodbye too many times before&lt;br&gt; And her heart is breaking in front of me&lt;br&gt; I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This love has taken its toll on me&lt;br&gt; She said Goodbye too many times before&lt;br&gt; And my heart is breaking in front of me&lt;br&gt; She said Goodbye too many times before&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This love has taken its toll on me&lt;br&gt; She said Goodbye too many times before&lt;br&gt; And her heart is breaking in front of me&lt;br&gt; I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore...&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

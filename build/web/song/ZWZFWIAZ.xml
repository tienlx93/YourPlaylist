    <Lyrics>Well I know the feeling&lt;br&gt; Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge&lt;br&gt; And there ain't no healing&lt;br&gt; From cutting yourself with the jagged edge&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm telling you that&lt;br&gt; Its never that bad&lt;br&gt; And taking that something is where at&lt;br&gt; Lay down on the floor&lt;br&gt; And your not sure&lt;br&gt; You can take this anymore&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So just give it one more try&lt;br&gt; To a lullaby&lt;br&gt; And turn this up on the radio&lt;br&gt; If you can hear me now&lt;br&gt; I'm reaching out&lt;br&gt; To let you know that you're not alone&lt;br&gt; And you can't tell&lt;br&gt; I'm scared as hell&lt;br&gt; Cause I can't get you on the telephone&lt;br&gt; So just close your eyes&lt;br&gt; Well honey here comes a lullaby&lt;br&gt; Your very own lullaby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Please let me take you&lt;br&gt; Out of the darkness and into the light&lt;br&gt; Cause I have faith in you&lt;br&gt; That you're gonna make it through another night&lt;br&gt; Stop thinking about&lt;br&gt; The easy way out&lt;br&gt; There's no need to go and blow the candle out&lt;br&gt; Because you're not done&lt;br&gt; You're far too young&lt;br&gt; And the best is yet to come&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So just give it one more try&lt;br&gt; To a lullaby&lt;br&gt; And turn this up on the radio&lt;br&gt; If you can hear me now&lt;br&gt; I'm reaching out&lt;br&gt; To let you know that you're not alone&lt;br&gt; http://www.elyricsworld.com/lullaby_lyrics_nickelback.html&lt;br&gt; And you can't tell&lt;br&gt; I'm scared as hell&lt;br&gt; Cause I can't get you on the telephone&lt;br&gt; So just close your eyes&lt;br&gt; Well honey here comes a lullaby&lt;br&gt; Your very own lullaby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well everybody's hit the bottom&lt;br&gt; And everybody's been forgotten&lt;br&gt; When everybody's tired of being alone&lt;br&gt; Yeah everybody's been abandoned&lt;br&gt; And left a little empty handed&lt;br&gt; So if you're out there barely hanging on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just give it one more try&lt;br&gt; To a lullaby&lt;br&gt; And turn this up on the radio&lt;br&gt; If you can hear me now&lt;br&gt; I'm reaching out&lt;br&gt; To let you know that you're not alone&lt;br&gt; And you can't tell&lt;br&gt; I'm scared as hell&lt;br&gt; Cause I can't get you on the telephone&lt;br&gt; So just close your eyes&lt;br&gt; Well honey here comes a lullaby&lt;br&gt; Your very own lullaby&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well honey here comes a lullaby&lt;br&gt; Your very own lullaby&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I looked in the sky&lt;br&gt; and there I saw a star&lt;br&gt; shining so bright above&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I closed my eyes&lt;br&gt; and wished upon the star&lt;br&gt; that I would find true love&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Someone who needed me..&lt;br&gt; Someone to share my life..&lt;br&gt; For a love that would be true I would wait forever&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So... no... matter how long it may be..&lt;br&gt; I will be waiting&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One star..&lt;br&gt; brighter than the others&lt;br&gt; Two Hearts..&lt;br&gt; beating for each other&lt;br&gt; I believe wishes really come true&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Love at first sight&lt;br&gt; I knew it from the moment&lt;br&gt; when you said hello&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I hoped you felt it too&lt;br&gt; but we were both so shy&lt;br&gt; how was I to know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; when you reached for my hand&lt;br&gt; I knew you were the one&lt;br&gt; We laughed and talked for hours&lt;br&gt; like I'd known you forever&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Like... a... dream or something from a book&lt;br&gt; True love has found me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One star..&lt;br&gt; brighter than the others&lt;br&gt; Two Hearts..&lt;br&gt; beating for each other&lt;br&gt; Now I see wishes really come true&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You just have to dream&lt;br&gt; Nothing's as bad as it seems to be..&lt;br&gt; believe me..&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Someone's waiting for you to try..&lt;br&gt; There in the sky..&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One star..&lt;br&gt; brighter than the others&lt;br&gt; Two Hearts..&lt;br&gt; beating for each other&lt;br&gt; You will see wishes really come true&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can't stop believing&lt;br&gt; wishes do come true&lt;br&gt; You gotta believe me (wish on a star)&lt;br&gt; wishes do come true...</Lyrics>

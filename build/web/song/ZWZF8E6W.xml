    <Lyrics>What have I got to do to make you love me&lt;br&gt; What have I got to do to make you care&lt;br&gt; What do I do when lightning strikes me&lt;br&gt; And I wake to find that you're not there&lt;br&gt; What do I do to make you want me&lt;br&gt; What have I got to do to be heard&lt;br&gt; What do I say when it's all over&lt;br&gt; And sorry seems to be the hardest word&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's sad, so sad&lt;br&gt; It's a sad, sad situation&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And it's getting more and more absurd&lt;br&gt; It's sad, so sad&lt;br&gt; Why can't we talk it over&lt;br&gt; Oh it seems to me&lt;br&gt; That sorry seems to be the hardest word&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What do I do to make you love me&lt;br&gt; What have I got to do to be heard&lt;br&gt; What do I do when lightning strikes me&lt;br&gt; What have I got to do&lt;br&gt; What have I got to do&lt;br&gt; When sorry seems to be the hardest word</Lyrics>

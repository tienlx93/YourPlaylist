    <Lyrics>Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,&lt;br&gt; That saved a wretch like me.&lt;br&gt; I once was lost but now am found,&lt;br&gt; Was blind, but now I see.&lt;br&gt; T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.&lt;br&gt; And Grace, my fears relieved.&lt;br&gt; How precious did that Grace appear&lt;br&gt; The hour I first believed.&lt;br&gt; Through many dangers, toils and snares&lt;br&gt; I have already come;&lt;br&gt; 'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far&lt;br&gt; and Grace will lead me home.&lt;br&gt; The Lord has promised good to me.&lt;br&gt; His word my hope secures.&lt;br&gt; He will my shield and portion be,&lt;br&gt; As long as life endures.&lt;br&gt; Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,&lt;br&gt; And mortal life shall cease,&lt;br&gt; I shall possess within the veil,&lt;br&gt; A life of joy and peace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When we've been here ten thousand years&lt;br&gt; Bright shining as the sun.&lt;br&gt; We've no less days to sing God's praise&lt;br&gt; Than when we've first begun.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,&lt;br&gt; That saved a wretch like me.&lt;br&gt; I once was lost but now am found,&lt;br&gt; Was blind, but now I see.</Lyrics>

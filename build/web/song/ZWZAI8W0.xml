    <Lyrics>(Hook)&lt;br&gt; I'm not afraid to take a stand&lt;br&gt; Everybody come take my hand&lt;br&gt; We'll walk this road together, through the storm&lt;br&gt; Whatever weather, cold or warm&lt;br&gt; Just let you know that, you're not alone&lt;br&gt; Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road&lt;br&gt; (Intro)&lt;br&gt; Yeah, It's been a ride...&lt;br&gt; I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one&lt;br&gt; Now some of you might still be in that place&lt;br&gt; If you're trying to get out, just follow me&lt;br&gt; I'll get you there&lt;br&gt; (Verse 1)&lt;br&gt; You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em&lt;br&gt; But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em&lt;br&gt; Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem&lt;br&gt; When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn&lt;br&gt; What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world&lt;br&gt; Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me&lt;br&gt; I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly&lt;br&gt; And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony&lt;br&gt; No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he&lt;br&gt; From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit and&lt;br&gt; Whether he's on salary, paid hourly&lt;br&gt; Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him&lt;br&gt; Whichever comes first, for better or worse&lt;br&gt; He's married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas&lt;br&gt; His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge&lt;br&gt; To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the universe&lt;br&gt; (Hook)&lt;br&gt; (Verse 2)&lt;br&gt; Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap&lt;br&gt; I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap&lt;br&gt; You said you was king, you lied through your teeth&lt;br&gt; For that fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped&lt;br&gt; And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back&lt;br&gt; I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact&lt;br&gt; Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was &quot;ehhhh&quot;&lt;br&gt; Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground&lt;br&gt; Relax, I ain't going back to that now&lt;br&gt; All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW&lt;br&gt; Cause I ain't playin' around&lt;br&gt; There's a game called circle and I don't know how&lt;br&gt; I'm way too up to back down&lt;br&gt; But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out&lt;br&gt; Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't&lt;br&gt; This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around&lt;br&gt; But it's time to exercise these demons&lt;br&gt; These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!&lt;br&gt; (Hook)&lt;br&gt; (Bridge)&lt;br&gt; And I just can't keep living this way&lt;br&gt; So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage&lt;br&gt; I'm standing up, Imma face my demons&lt;br&gt; I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground&lt;br&gt; I've had enough, now I'm so fed up&lt;br&gt; Time to put my life back together right now&lt;br&gt; (Verse 3)&lt;br&gt; It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me&lt;br&gt; Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you&lt;br&gt; So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through&lt;br&gt; And don't even realise what you did, believe me you&lt;br&gt; I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger&lt;br&gt; I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of&lt;br&gt; My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead&lt;br&gt; No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise&lt;br&gt; To focus soley on handling my responsibility's as a father&lt;br&gt; So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it&lt;br&gt; You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely&lt;br&gt; Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club&lt;br&gt; Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up&lt;br&gt; Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon&lt;br&gt; But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and&lt;br&gt; (Hook)</Lyrics>

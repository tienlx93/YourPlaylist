    <Lyrics>I'm at war with the world and they&lt;br&gt; Try to pull me into the dark&lt;br&gt; I struggle to find my faith&lt;br&gt; As I'm slippin' from Your arms&lt;br&gt; It's getting harder to stay awake&lt;br&gt; And my strength is fading fast&lt;br&gt; You breathe into me at last!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm awake! I'm alive!&lt;br&gt; Now I know what I believe inside!&lt;br&gt; Now! It's my time!&lt;br&gt; I'll do what I want, 'cause this is my life!&lt;br&gt; Here! (Right here!)&lt;br&gt; Right now! (Right now!)&lt;br&gt; I'll stand my ground, and never back down;&lt;br&gt; I know what I believe inside,&lt;br&gt; I'm awake and I'm alive!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm at war with the world cause I&lt;br&gt; Ain't never gonna sell my soul&lt;br&gt; I've already made up my mind&lt;br&gt; No matter what, I can't be bought or sold&lt;br&gt; When my faith is getting weak&lt;br&gt; And I feel like giving in&lt;br&gt; You breathe into me again!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm awake! I'm alive!&lt;br&gt; Now I know what I believe inside!&lt;br&gt; Now! It's my time!&lt;br&gt; I'll do what I want, 'cause this is my life!&lt;br&gt; Here! (Right here!)&lt;br&gt; Right now! (Right now!)&lt;br&gt; I'll stand my ground, and never back down;&lt;br&gt; I know what I believe inside,&lt;br&gt; I'm awake and I'm alive!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Waking up! Waking up!&lt;br&gt; Waking up! Waking up!&lt;br&gt; Waking up! Waking up!&lt;br&gt; Waking up! Waking up!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In the dark,&lt;br&gt; I can feel you in my sleep,&lt;br&gt; In your arms I feel you breathe into me;&lt;br&gt; Forever hold this heart that I will give to You,&lt;br&gt; Forever I will live for You!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm awake! I'm alive!&lt;br&gt; Now I know what I believe inside!&lt;br&gt; Now! It's my time!&lt;br&gt; I'll do what I want, 'cause this is my life!&lt;br&gt; Here! (Right here!)&lt;br&gt; Right now! (Right now!)&lt;br&gt; I'll stand my ground, and never back down;&lt;br&gt; I know what I believe inside,&lt;br&gt; I'm awake and I'm alive!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Waking up! Waking up!&lt;br&gt; Waking up! Waking up!&lt;br&gt; Waking up! Waking up!&lt;br&gt; Waking up! Waking up!</Lyrics>

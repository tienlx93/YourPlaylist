    <Lyrics>&quot;Outside&quot;&lt;br&gt; (feat. Ellie Goulding)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Look at what you've done&lt;br&gt; Stand still, falling away from me&lt;br&gt; When it takes so long&lt;br&gt; Fire's out, what do you want to be?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now I'm holding on&lt;br&gt; Myself was never enough for me&lt;br&gt; Gotta be so strong&lt;br&gt; There's a power in what you do&lt;br&gt; Now every other day I'll be watching you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll show you what it feels like&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; We did everything right&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; I'll show you what it feels like&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; We did everything right&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So, you give me no reason&lt;br&gt; For me to stay close to you&lt;br&gt; Tell me what lovers do&lt;br&gt; How are we still breathing?&lt;br&gt; It's never for us to choose&lt;br&gt; I'll be the strength in you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now I'm holding on (I'm holding on)&lt;br&gt; Myself was never enough for me&lt;br&gt; Gotta be so strong&lt;br&gt; There's a power in what you do&lt;br&gt; Now every other day I'll be watching you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll show you what it feels like&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; We did everything right&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; I'll show you what it feels like&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; We did everything right&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll show you what it feels like&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; I'll show you what it feels like&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'll show you what it feels like&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside&lt;br&gt; We did everything right&lt;br&gt; Now I'm on the outside</Lyrics>

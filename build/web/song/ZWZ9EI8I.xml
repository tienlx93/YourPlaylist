    <Lyrics>A hundred days have made me older&lt;br&gt; Since the last time that I saw your pretty face&lt;br&gt; A thousand lies have made me colder&lt;br&gt; And I don't think I can look at this the same&lt;br&gt; But all the miles that separate&lt;br&gt; Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm here without you baby&lt;br&gt; But you're still on my lonely mind&lt;br&gt; I think about you baby&lt;br&gt; And I dream about you all the time&lt;br&gt; I'm here without you baby&lt;br&gt; But you're still with me in my dreams&lt;br&gt; And tonight it's only you and me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The miles just keep rollin'&lt;br&gt; As the people leave their way to say hello&lt;br&gt; I've heard this life is overrated&lt;br&gt; But I hope that it gets better as we go&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm here without you baby&lt;br&gt; But you're still on my lonely mind&lt;br&gt; I think about you baby&lt;br&gt; And I dream about you all the time&lt;br&gt; I'm here without you baby&lt;br&gt; But you're still with me in my dreams&lt;br&gt; And tonight girl its only you and me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Everything I know, and anywhere I go&lt;br&gt; It gets hard but it wont take away my love&lt;br&gt; And when the last one falls&lt;br&gt; When it's all said and done&lt;br&gt; It gets hard but it wont take away my love&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I'm here without you baby&lt;br&gt; But you're still on my lonely mind&lt;br&gt; I think about you baby&lt;br&gt; And I dream about you all the time&lt;br&gt; I'm here without you baby&lt;br&gt; But you're still with me in my dreams&lt;br&gt; And tonight girl its only you and me&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

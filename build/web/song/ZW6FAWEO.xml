    <Lyrics>I got a piece of land out in the countryside&lt;br&gt; Lay back and smell the Sun warm up the Georgia pine&lt;br&gt; Feels so good to be taking it easy&lt;br&gt; Why would I ever leave? Cause I know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I got some good friends that live down the street&lt;br&gt; Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me&lt;br&gt; Here in a small town, where it feels like home&lt;br&gt; I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Verse 2]&lt;br&gt; We got a fire going down by the riverside&lt;br&gt; Sip whiskey out the bottle, living like we'll never die&lt;br&gt; Come on and stay a while if you don't believe me&lt;br&gt; Why would I ever leave, cause I know&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus]&lt;br&gt; I got some good friends that live down the street&lt;br&gt; Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me&lt;br&gt; Here in a small town, where it feels like home&lt;br&gt; I've got everything I need and nothing that I don't&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Chorus 2]&lt;br&gt; I got some good friends that live down the street&lt;br&gt; Got a good looking woman with her arms 'round me&lt;br&gt; Here in a small town, where it feels like home&lt;br&gt; I've got everything I need&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; And nothing that I don't&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; Everything I need&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; And nothing I don't&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Bridge]&lt;br&gt; It's the weight that you carry from the the things that you think you want&lt;br&gt; It's the weight that you carry from the the things that you think you want&lt;br&gt; Weight you carry&lt;br&gt; It's the weight that you carry from the the things that you think you want&lt;br&gt; It's the weight that you carry from the the things that you think you want&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I've got everything I need, nothing that I don't&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; Everything I need, nothing that I don't&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; Everything I need, nothing that I don't&lt;br&gt; Homegrown&lt;br&gt; Oh, everything I need and nothing that I don't&lt;br&gt; Homegrown</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>&quot;Lose Yourself&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity&lt;br&gt; To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment&lt;br&gt; Would you capture it or just let it slip?&lt;br&gt; Yo&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy&lt;br&gt; There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti&lt;br&gt; He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,&lt;br&gt; but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down,&lt;br&gt; the whole crowd goes so loud&lt;br&gt; He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out&lt;br&gt; He's choking how, everybody's joking now&lt;br&gt; The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!&lt;br&gt; Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity&lt;br&gt; Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked&lt;br&gt; He's so mad, but he won't give up that&lt;br&gt; Easy, no&lt;br&gt; He won't have it , he knows his whole back's to these ropes&lt;br&gt; It don't matter, he's dope&lt;br&gt; He knows that, but he's broke&lt;br&gt; He's so stagnant that he knows&lt;br&gt; When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's&lt;br&gt; Back to the lab again, yo&lt;br&gt; This whole rhapsody&lt;br&gt; He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook:]&lt;br&gt; You better lose yourself in the music, the moment&lt;br&gt; You own it, you better never let it go&lt;br&gt; You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow&lt;br&gt; This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo&lt;br&gt; (You better)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping&lt;br&gt; This world is mine for the taking&lt;br&gt; Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order&lt;br&gt; A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem&lt;br&gt; It only grows harder, only grows hotter&lt;br&gt; He blows us all over these hoes is all on him&lt;br&gt; Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter&lt;br&gt; Lonely roads, God only knows&lt;br&gt; He's grown farther from home, he's no father&lt;br&gt; He goes home and barely knows his own daughter&lt;br&gt; But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water&lt;br&gt; His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product&lt;br&gt; They moved on to the next schmoe who flows&lt;br&gt; He nose dove and sold nada&lt;br&gt; So the soap opera is told and unfolds&lt;br&gt; I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on&lt;br&gt; Da da dum da dum da da&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; No more games, I'ma change what you call rage&lt;br&gt; Tear this motherfucking roof off like 2 dogs caged&lt;br&gt; I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed&lt;br&gt; I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage&lt;br&gt; But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher&lt;br&gt; Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper&lt;br&gt; All the pain inside amplified by the fact&lt;br&gt; That I can't get by with my 9 to 5&lt;br&gt; And I can't provide the right type of life for my family&lt;br&gt; Cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers&lt;br&gt; And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life&lt;br&gt; And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder&lt;br&gt; Trying to feed and water my seed, plus&lt;br&gt; Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna&lt;br&gt; Baby mama drama's screaming on and&lt;br&gt; Too much for me to wanna&lt;br&gt; Stay in one spot, another day of monotony&lt;br&gt; Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail&lt;br&gt; I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot&lt;br&gt; Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not&lt;br&gt; Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go&lt;br&gt; I cannot grow old in Salem's lot&lt;br&gt; So here I go it's my shot.&lt;br&gt; Feet fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; [Hook]&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can do anything you set your mind to, man</Lyrics>

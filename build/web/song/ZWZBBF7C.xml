    <Lyrics>You Are Not Alone&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Another day has gone &lt;br&gt; I'm still all alone &lt;br&gt; How could this be &lt;br&gt; You're not here with me &lt;br&gt; You never said goodbye &lt;br&gt; Someone tell me why &lt;br&gt; Did you have to go &lt;br&gt; And leave my world so cold &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Everyday I sit and ask myself &lt;br&gt; How did love slip away &lt;br&gt; Something whispers in my ear and says &lt;br&gt; That you are not alone &lt;br&gt; For I am here with you &lt;br&gt; Though you're far away &lt;br&gt; I am here to stay &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are not alone &lt;br&gt; I am here with you &lt;br&gt; Though we're far apart &lt;br&gt; You're always in my heart &lt;br&gt; You are not alone &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; All alone &lt;br&gt; Why, oh &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just the other night &lt;br&gt; I thought I heard you cry &lt;br&gt; Asking me to come &lt;br&gt; And hold you in my arms &lt;br&gt; I can hear your prayers &lt;br&gt; Your burdens I will bear &lt;br&gt; But first I need your hand &lt;br&gt; So forever can begin &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Everyday I sit and ask myself &lt;br&gt; How did love slip away &lt;br&gt; Then something whispers in my ear and says &lt;br&gt; That you are not alone &lt;br&gt; For I am here with you &lt;br&gt; Though you're far away &lt;br&gt; I am here to stay &lt;br&gt; For you are not alone &lt;br&gt; I am here with you &lt;br&gt; Though we're far apart &lt;br&gt; You're always in my heart &lt;br&gt; And you are not alone &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Whisper three words and I'll come runnin' &lt;br&gt; And girl you know that I'll be there &lt;br&gt; I'll be there &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are not alone &lt;br&gt; I am here with you &lt;br&gt; Though you're far away &lt;br&gt; I am here to stay &lt;br&gt; You are not alone &lt;br&gt; I am here with you &lt;br&gt; Though we're far apart &lt;br&gt; You're always in my heart &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You are not alone &lt;br&gt; For I am here with you &lt;br&gt; Though you're far away &lt;br&gt; I am here to stay &lt;br&gt; For you are not alone &lt;br&gt; For I am here with you &lt;br&gt; Though we're far apart &lt;br&gt; You're always in my heart &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; For you are not alone</Lyrics>

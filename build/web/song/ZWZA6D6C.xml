    <Lyrics>It was just like yesterday&lt;br&gt; When you choose to leave and I to stay&lt;br&gt; It was a warm and sunny day&lt;br&gt; But my heart felt as heavy as stone&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Never told me where you went&lt;br&gt; Then again I never try to ask&lt;br&gt; Now I know in life you have one chance&lt;br&gt; And you better use it well&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When the mountains fall&lt;br&gt; And the oceans flood&lt;br&gt; I'm still in search of you&lt;br&gt; Only thing I want to say&lt;br&gt; I'm still in love with you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Finally I found your place&lt;br&gt; Sadly I came three summers late&lt;br&gt; Now I'm sitting by your grave&lt;br&gt; And I sing this song for you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When the mountains fall&lt;br&gt; And the oceans flood&lt;br&gt; I'm still in search of you&lt;br&gt; Only thing i want to say&lt;br&gt; I'm still in love with you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; One last thing&lt;br&gt; I have to say&lt;br&gt; I'm still in love with you</Lyrics>

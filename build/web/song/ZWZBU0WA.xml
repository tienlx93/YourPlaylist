    <Lyrics>Where is the moment we needed the most&lt;br&gt; You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost&lt;br&gt; They tell me your blue skies fade to grey&lt;br&gt; They tell me your passion's gone away&lt;br&gt; And I don't need no carryin' on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You stand in the line just to hit a new low&lt;br&gt; You're faking a smile with the coffee to go&lt;br&gt; You tell me your life's been way off line&lt;br&gt; You're falling to pieces everytime&lt;br&gt; And I don't need no carryin' on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause you had a bad day&lt;br&gt; You're taking one down&lt;br&gt; You sing a sad song just to turn it around&lt;br&gt; You say you don't know&lt;br&gt; You tell me don't lie&lt;br&gt; You work at a smile and you go for a ride&lt;br&gt; You had a bad day&lt;br&gt; The camera don't lie&lt;br&gt; You're coming back down and you really don't mind&lt;br&gt; You had a bad day&lt;br&gt; You had a bad day&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Well you need a blue sky holiday&lt;br&gt; The point is they laugh at what you say&lt;br&gt; And I don't need no carryin' on&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You had a bad day&lt;br&gt; You're taking one down&lt;br&gt; You sing a sad song just to turn it around&lt;br&gt; You say you don't know&lt;br&gt; You tell me don't lie&lt;br&gt; You work at a smile and you go for a ride&lt;br&gt; You had a bad day&lt;br&gt; The camera don't lie&lt;br&gt; You're coming back down and you really don't mind&lt;br&gt; You had a bad day&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; (Oh.. Holiday..)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sometimes the system goes on the blink&lt;br&gt; And the whole thing turns out wrong&lt;br&gt; You might not make it back and you know&lt;br&gt; That you could be well oh that strong&lt;br&gt; And I'm not wrong&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; So where is the passion when you need it the most&lt;br&gt; Oh you and I&lt;br&gt; You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Cause you had a bad day&lt;br&gt; You're taking one down&lt;br&gt; You sing a sad song just to turn it around&lt;br&gt; You say you don't know&lt;br&gt; You tell me don't lie&lt;br&gt; You work at a smile and you go for a ride&lt;br&gt; You had a bad day&lt;br&gt; You've seen what you like&lt;br&gt; And how does it feel for one more time&lt;br&gt; You had a bad day&lt;br&gt; You had a bad day&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Had a bad day&lt;br&gt; Had a bad day&lt;br&gt; Had a bad day&lt;br&gt; Had a bad day&lt;br&gt; Had a bad day&lt;br&gt;</Lyrics>

    <Lyrics>I don't know what it is that makes me love you so&lt;br&gt; I only know I never want to let you go&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see&lt;br&gt; That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me?&lt;br&gt; It happens to be true&lt;br&gt; I only want to be with you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; It doesn't matter where you go or what you do&lt;br&gt; I want to spend each moment of the day with you&lt;br&gt; Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss&lt;br&gt; I never knew that I could be in love like this&lt;br&gt; It's crazy but it's true&lt;br&gt; I only want to be with you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You stopped and smiled at me&lt;br&gt; And asked if I'd care to dance&lt;br&gt; I fell into your open arms&lt;br&gt; I didn't stand a chance&lt;br&gt; Now, listen to me&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I just want to be beside you everywhere&lt;br&gt; As long as we're together, honey, I don't care&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see&lt;br&gt; That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me?&lt;br&gt; No matter what you do,&lt;br&gt; I only want to be with you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ohhh&lt;br&gt; You stopped and smiled at me&lt;br&gt; And asked if I'd care to dance&lt;br&gt; I fell into your open arms&lt;br&gt; I didn't stand a chance&lt;br&gt; Now, hear me tell you&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I just want to be beside you everywhere&lt;br&gt; As long as we're together, honey, I don't care&lt;br&gt; 'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see&lt;br&gt; That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me?&lt;br&gt; No matter what you do,&lt;br&gt; I only want to be with you</Lyrics>
